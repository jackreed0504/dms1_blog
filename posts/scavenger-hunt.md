*In our first class in the Digital Media Studio, we were instructed to take on a scavenger hunt around the University campus. Provided only with cryptic clues, our brave team of Sharon, Gavin, Sue-Jee and I embarked on a perilous journey which would test our courage, wits and intelligence...*

Okay, that's a bit of an overstatement. The truth is, the four of us roamed cluelessly around the campus as we tried to figure out what on earth any of the clues even meant. If you had seen us on the grounds, we likely looked a lot less like the brave warriors I just described, and more like a group of confused Uni students on their first day.

Despite struggling with many of these puzzling riddles, our group had a clear advantage: *me*. Yes, I know that is arrogant, but it is true. Previously, I had undertaken three semesters of Bachelor of Arts (Music Industry) at RMIT before I transferred to Digital Media. This meant that I was familiar with the campus, which helped us figure out some of the items in the scavenger hunt...

Firstly, we all agreed that the clue "A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land." clearly described a vending machine. Using my somewhat photographic memory of the campus, I directed the team towards the vending machine located in Building 10, and Sharon used her cellular device's camera to capture what may be described as a "selfie" of all of us in front. (Pictured above)

The clue "A study space fit for a Sith Lord." immediately reminded me of the "Star Wars pods", a study space connected to the library which I had favoured for writing my essays between classes during the past three semesters. As a group we journeyed over to the peaceful study room and took the above selfie as proof of our discovery.

We all agreed that one of the clues, "A door for the condemned." hinted at the Old Melbourne Gaol, which is connected to and preserved with RMIT either due to its historical significance, or as a metaphor for the feeling of having lots of assignments to do. While I knew it was part of the campus and had actually been many times, it somehow hadn't occured to me and we had to use Google maps, which directed us the long way round >:(

At this point, the confusion had really set in. None of these clues rung a bell of anything we could think of! As we wondered aimlessly around, Gavin noticed a statue of two giand hands, which seemed to line up with the clue "The disembodied hands of a great ape."

![black box](/static/w01s1/scavenger_5.jpg)

One of the clues, "A basement-dwelling Black Box, bigger than you might think." didn't give us any ideas which we were confident in, though it did remind me of the basement recording studios in building 6, which I used in the days of old. It *is* quite dark down there... like, when the lights are off. We decided this was our best shot and took our selfie infront of the radio studio, because the windows seemed to be black.

![roots](/static/w01s1/scavenger_6.jpg)

While we were initially confused about what "A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor.", it suddenly struck us that this could refer to the roots growing along the fence and the walls, and the statue which depicts Bundjil the Great Creator Spirit (which unfortunately didn't make it into the selfie).

![coffee](/static/w01s1/scavenger_7.jpg)

Along our journey we ran into another group, who were also quite lost, and we decided to trade clues. While this could be percieved as cheating, our instructor Thomas had described our class as a "Community of Practice", which means cheating off of eachother is okay! The other group had not been able to confidently figure out what the "explosive coffee" really was, or whether such a coffee would be safe to drink, so they had just settled on a random coffee shop around campus and we ended up doing the same.

![book](/static/w01s1/scavenger_8.jpg)

Likewise, the other group wasn't quite sure what book "A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many." referred to, so had just selected a relevant book in the library. We did the same, selecting a book on Graphic Design to include in the photograph. Unfortunately, we had never got to find out what the "golden globe atop a tower of eights." was, as it was time to journey back to our classroom.
