*In our first class in the Digital Media Studio, we were instructed to take on a scavenger hunt around the University campus. Provided only with cryptic clues, our brave team of Sharon, Gavin, Sue-Jee and I embarked on a perilous journey which would test our courage, wits and intelligence...*
Okay, that's a bit of an overstatement. The truth is, the four of us roamed cluelessly around the campus as we tried to figure out what on earth any of the clues even meant. If you had seen us on the grounds, we likely looked a lot less like the brave warriors I just described, and more like a group of confused Uni students on their first day.
