# Reflection
## Self-Reflection Questions

In our final assignment, we will be creating a prototype for a portfolio website for our own creative practice. This means we will be representing our work in the semester thus far, and will need to write about this as well as our creative practice in general. To help us to reflect on our work, we were encouraged for homework to answer the following self-reflection questions about the last three assignments in this class:

### Assignment 1
* How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?
	* I used the rhythm of the music to dictate when the shots would be cut, making the video feel calm (as with the music) and harmonious. I tried to pick imagery which was still and relaxed to fit the relaxed music. 
* How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?
	* I wanted the film to evoke ideas of introvertedness and introspection, so I chose imagery which symbolised these ideas (pouring tea, vinyl record). I also wanted to create a relaxed mood, which I supported with imagery such as shots of nature.
* What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?
	* I learned that I can engage in people’s volitional attention by choosing sounds that represent and evoke particular emotions, to create meaning for the viewer. I wanted to create a relaxed feeling to convey to the viewer that I am an introverted and introspective person, so I used a relaxed, fingerstyle guitar soundtrack. In addition, I used some sounds which would materialise the relaxing imagery in the scenes, such as the sound of tea pouring over the video of tea pouring.
* How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?
	* I cut each shot to the beat of the relaxed music, which helped give the entire video a relaxed feel. Each image was held on screen for around 4 seconds, making the video feel calm rather than intense. I used the editing concepts of j cuts and l cuts to emphasise the continuation and evolution of time, particularly with a shot of a clock at the end where the sound of the clock ticking continues after the video goes black. 
* Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait? 
	* My introversion, my introspection, and my interest in art and music and design.
* What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?
	* Vibrant colours and calming imagery with a relaxed pace in the editing created a feeling of calmness and harmony to reflect my introversion. I reflected my interest in art and design through the use of carefully composed shots, and drawing attention to these compositions and their uses of  matching shapes via match cuts. I reflected my particular love for folk music by making a fingerstyle acoustic soundtrack to the video, which had a softness and a relaxed tempo to convey my introversion.

### Assignment 2
* How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?
	* The idea was interface icons for an RPG, which fit its surreal and psychedelic “steam punk” theme, and stylised visual appearance. I chose the theme “dream”, as I felt this would be an appropriate theme to allow me to explore stylised and playful visuals.
* Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?
	* While the icon designs themselves remained mostly the same, I tried different backgrounds for each of the icons, including using gradients vs block colours, and jagged shapes vs a perfect spiral. I stuck with the gradients and the jagged spiral as this helped me convey the psychedelic and stylised look of the game.
* How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained? 
	* I chose the most successful thumbnails and created the basic shapes with the shape tools, pathfinder tools and pen tool. I think for most of them things were gained in translation, as it was clearer to see what worked better made with basic shapes. For instance, the ray-gun became a pistol as it was a much clearer icon.
* How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?
	* Most of the icons used the same analogous colour scheme to create a sense of unity, but one (the skull) used a different, red one to generate interest and help it stand out. I used a purple and blue colour scheme for most of the icons to evoke a psychedelic and dreamy theme.
* How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?
	* Most of my sounds accessed user’s reactional attention by materialising the icons: for instance, pressing the gun icon would play the sound of a gun reloading. For other icons, I used psychedelic sounds which would evoke a dreamy mood, such as the ‘Dream Machine” button which I created by automating a delay in Ableton to make trippy sounds.
* How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?
	* First of all, I needed to choose an application for my designs, through which the prompt (Dreams) would be reflected. I chose to create my icons through a stylised, steampunk themed RPG about a scientist with a dream machine. I ideated some icons through thumbnailing that would represent the functions of this game, while reflecting a steampunk theme using midcentury items, and reflect a dream theme through imagery such as swirls and moons. I translated these designs into vector images, which used the same iconography but with a largely purple and dark blue colour scheme which would help reflect the dream prompt.

### Assignment 3
* How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?
	* Unlike many other forms of design, a digital environment is 3 dimensional and navigable. Creating a working prototype in the form of a grey box prototype allowed me to explore how my design would come across to somebody who is able to move their character around and view it from all positions and angles. This was integral to my process, as it helped me reevaluate my use of navigational and spatial principles by testing how they worked. 
* How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?
	* Firstly, my experience was different due to my lack of prior experience working with this medium, meaning I was learning as I went in a very unfamiliar program. One of the big differences is that the user is largely able to control how the design appears, giving me less control over the visual appearance. To direct the viewer, I had to focus on navigational principles to ensure they were interacting with the environment in the way I wanted them to, while this is somewhat similar to the idea of leading their eye in a design for instance, it is a lot harder to make the design look in a particular, desired way.
* What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?
	* In Assignment 1, I as the artist used a camera to frame shots in a way that conveyed an intended meaning to the audience, having the complete power to dictate where the camera was positioned. In Assignment 3, the user is able to control the camera themselves. While it is possible to direct the viewer, so that they will frame the scene in the way you intend, the virtual camera differs in that they have the complete freedom to frame the project in the way that they would like. 
* How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2? 
	* In both Assignment 1 and 2, I had engaged both user’s volitional and reactional attention. For instance, in Assignment 1, I had engaged user’s volitional attention via the use of relaxing fingerstyle guitar music, and engaged their reactional attention by materialising some of the objects in the shot (clock ticking, tea pouring, crackling vinyl record). In Assignment 2, I engaged user’s reactional attention by materialising icon sounds (gun reloading on pistol symbol) and engaged their volitional attention using sounds that evoked a mood (trippy sounds to evoke dreamy, psychedelic mood). In assignment 3, I followed similar principals, using sound effects that would materialise the environment (outdoors ambience) and materialise the actions (picking up watering can, watering the trees) to engage users reactional attention and use music that evoked a nostalgic mood to engage their volitional attention and evoke the theme of growing up. What was different was my use of sound for navigation: I engaged user’s reactional attention by creating a pinging sound from the trees which would draw the user towards them, and engaged their volitional attention by having the music add instruments depending on the location of the user, making the music evolve up to a climax point to evoke the theme of change. 
* How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?
	* The theme of Assignment 3 was change, which we had to represent through a meaningful change which has happened to us, using changes in the environment. I focused on my change into adulthood. I initially wanted to have the player water trees in the environment, growing until they are big enough to climb a mountain and look into a mirror at the top showing how the character has changed. I got rid of the idea of the character growing, as the physics didn’t work in the way I thought it would (growing bigger making it easier to climb the mountain) , and the idea of the character’s appearance changing didn’t reflect a change in the environment so I got rid of the mirrors. I added new ways to represent this: I added an archway on top of the mountain which would show the world in greyscale when you look back through it, conveying the idea of looking backwards into the past. After discovering what was and wasn’t successful through play testing, I wanted to express the feeling of nostalgia better so I added music which I felt expressed that emotion. I also added a final tree on top of the hill which held flowers and fruits, displaying maturity to make it more clear the environment was about growing up.
* What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?
	* I discovered that, while most people have the instinct to interact with something they are drawn to so they can see if it does anything (ie. picking up the watering can), this is not always the case for everyone, and it is often necessary to include guiding text. I also found that trees do not universally represent growth for people; a tree with no leaves can represent death for some people. 

## Revisiting Documentation

In order to help us with reflecting on our past work, for homework we are encouraged to find past process documentation and reflections which can help us communicate our progress along the semester. Here are the pieces I believe will be useful:

### Assignment 1

* In the [Week 2 Session 2 blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w2s2), I described the importance of a key moment in my storyboard and how I would achieve the use of audio in this part. In this post, I described my assignment concept and use of audio. Here, I discuss my use of match-cuts, which focus on the "similar shapes and slow movements" between the first 3 shots. I discuss using relaxed music in 3/4 time to give the video a calm feeling, and editing the shots on beat to reinforce this emotion. I also discussed materialising some of the sounds in the video here. 

* In the description for my Assignment 1 draft on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SM4SHPsg0&ab_channel=JackReed), I describe a lot of these things in a more condensed way, which can be helpful for me when writing a succinct artist statement.

### Assignment 2

* In the [Week 4 Session 1 (Part 2) blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w4s1(2)), I brainstormed many of the ideas that I ended up choosing for my icon designs, but most importantly, in this post I described the idea for my video game and the intended audience, which will be key in writing my artist's statement.

* In the [Week 4 Session 2 (Part 2) blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w4s2(2)), I thumbnailed the icon designs and chose the most effective ones, describing why they were effective. These descriptions could be quite useful in describing my choices in an artists' statement. 

* In the [Week 5 Session 1 (Part 2) blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w5s1(2)), I trialed different colour schemes and evaluated which ones worked and why. This will be useful in describing and justifying my use of audio in my artists' statment.

* In the [Week 6 Session 1 blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w6s1), I described the sound for each icon and why I chose it. This will be useful for describing the audio part, and my intentions in the artists' statement. 

### Assignment 3

* In the [Week 7 Session 1 blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w7s1), I planned out my idea for the environment, including the meaning, and a map with descriptions of what each element would do and how it would convey my idea. While a lot of this changed over the course of developing the envrionment, many of it should be useful for helping me articulate how I supported my concepts through the environment. I also discuss my use of cel-shading here.

* In the [Week 8 Session 2 blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w8s2), I described how I used sound in the envrionment and why, including my use of sounds to materialise the environment, guide the user towards the trees, and making a soundtrack which evolves over the course of the user's navigation.

* In the blogposts for the two playtesting sessions [(Part 1)](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w9s1(3)) [(Part 2)](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w9s2), I display the results from my survey, and reflect on what parts did and didn't work and how I could change them. This can help me to discuss the process of feedback in developing my digital environment, and the importance of the user's control of the camera in how the message is conveyed. 

# Planning website
## Planning the structure

To plan out our website, we have first been tasked with planning out the structure. Firstly, as part of the **emapthise** stage of design thinking, we are to answer three questions which relate to the user of our webpage. This will help us understand who our user is, what we want to communicate with them, and how to effectively communicate with this user. These are integral things to consider when designing a UX (User Experience).

### Questions
* What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
    * A lot of my work thus far has taken on a stylised appearance. I want the user to think of the words "stylised", "playful", "psychedelic", and "fantasy".
    * Contrastingly, I also want my skills as a designer to be clear. I want the user to associate words like "designerly", "clean" and "sleek" with the website.

* Who is the target audience?
    * The target audience will be people who are looking to hire me as a digital media designer (or sound engineer). 
    * I also want to target people who are interested in design and art, so they can find out about me and my work.

* What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?
    * Images and examples of my work
    * Contact information/ways to access social media
    * Easy to access information about my work and myself
    * A layout and use of animations which reflect my skills in digital design

I sketched out how I may achieve this, and the order/layout for what should appear on the site:

## Artist Statement plans

### Assignment 1 ("i")

Where do we draw the line at what is considered a self portrait? Over the course of art history, artists have rendered themselves through different mediums and styles, depictions ranging from photorealistic to completely distorted. *i* is a self-portrait, realised through the medium of digital video, although it rarely depicts me in person. Instead, using my smartphone camera, I sought to capture videos which evoked parts of my personality, such as my introverted nature and my passion for design, art and music. Footage and soothing sounds of a vinyl record needle being dropped, tea being poured into a mug, the wavering oscillations of guitar strings and more are conjured into a montage, floating along to a fingerstyle guitar piece which I wrote for the project. The visual and auditory experiences coallesce to form a mosaic of myself, exposing my personality to the viewer.

### Assignment 2 ("Project: Dreamweaver")

*Project: Dreamweaver* is a classic psychedelic RPG game about a mad scientist with an invention that will change everything: a ramshackle machine that lets him enter people's dreams and defeat the monsters giving them nightmares. I created a suite of buttons for this game which aim to capture what is at the game's soul: a quirky, steampunk-influenced world held together by fun, stylised art. I captured elements of this game's sensibilities using a colour scheme of dreamy, deep blues, and the motif of a jagged spiral shape to for a stylised and fun aesthetic. Some icons depict midcentury objects, such as an old fashioned suitcase, to fit in with the game's steampunk style. Others represent the dream concept using symbols like moons. The central part of the icons are made with basic shapes and are all white, giving them a modern simplicity which makes them accessible and straightforward. These elements are used across the icons, making them unified and consistent. 

### Assignment 3 ("Blossom")

While growth is a progression, we seem to look back the more we move forward. Inspired by my recent move from my teenage years into early adulthood, *Blossom* is a digital environment which explores the changes, as well as the introspection, which take place during the transition into becoming an adult. I was influenced by video games Ōkami for its depictions of growth and changing environments, and Minecraft for its gorgeous, meloncholic soundtrack. The player begins, dominated by a large metal entrance, but finishes on a tall mountain overlooking the world, while the soundtrack evolves dynamically. Using a watering can, the player can grow bare trees into verdant ones, the final one blossoming with flowers and fruit. But as they cultivate this future, the past lingers: the lofi pianos, analog synths and mellotrons of the soundtrack evoke feelings of meloncholy and nostalgia, and by the end, the player looks back at the landscape through a greyscale window into the past.
