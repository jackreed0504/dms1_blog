In class, the other students playtested one another's digital environments, and provided feedback through their Google Forms surveys. I wasn't able to make it, so I sent it to some of my classmates for feedback instead. This helped me identify how I can improve my digital environment to make it more easily navigable and conceptually clear.

# Survey results and notes for improvement

### Did you experience any technical frustrations? If so, please describe them below:

As with the last round of playtesting the issue of mouse sensitivity has been brought up, so this is clearly an issue I should focus on. One playtester had lag problems with Unity play, however this doesn't seem to have effected other participants.

### Describe what you felt the concept and meaning of this 3D environment was

![2](/w10s1/2.png)

Two of the responses did mention "growth", which is definitely an integral concept to my environment. I will note that this is the reading by my classmates (who know this should represent change), while this reading did not come up in my last round of playtesting. However, I think I will need to make it more clear that the environment specifically represents becoming an adult.

### What emotions did you feel while navigating the environment?

Like the last round of playtesting, calm and relaxing emotions were the most common, which were part of the intention, but I need to do more work in order to elicit feelings of nostalgia and meloncholy. Like I mentioned last time, features like lo-fi pianos in the sound track could be an effective way to achieve this.

### Did you find the environment easy and clear to navigate?

It was generally agreed that the environment was easy to navigate, though I think the problem with some trees being 'easy to ignore' may have been caused by either the trees not standing out enough (maybe they are too small), or hidden behind the hilly terrain.

### Did you feel like there was a highlight or a landmark of the environment? If so, what?

This was the result I was hoping for, with both the central tree and the hill with the arch as the points which I wanted to stand out as landmarks in the environment.

### The environment evolved throughout the journey

While in the last round of playtesting, 100% of the results "agreed", with the new responses added in this dropped to 60%, with 40% responding neutral. Having spoken to some of the playtesters afterwards, I think this might have been due to some not realising they were supposed to pick up the watering can and water the trees, so I may have to make this clearer, perhaps by using text when the user hovers over the watering can.
