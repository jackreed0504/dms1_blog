# Figma Basics

In class, we learned the basic functions of Figma, such as creating artboards, shapes, gradients, text and prototype interactions and animations. These are the main things that we will need to know to use the application to make our portfolio website for Assignment 3. 

Figma works similarly to Adobe Illustrator, with very similar tools. For instance, the program uses artboards. In Figma, you can choose to make artboards the size of the screens you are designing for. Here, I have three desktop sized artboards and 3 iPhone 13/14 sized artboards. Having multiple of each is an effective way to trial different designs and compare them side by side.

I used the shape tool to create a rectangle the size of the artboard and a circle, and used the fill option to fill them with gradients. There is an option to add effects to objects, so I added drop shadows and inner shadows to the circle and gave it a large blur and spread to make it look like a 3D bubble. Command+D as expected allowed me to duplicate this, and I was able to scale them uniformly on all axes by transforming them while holding shift. I used two circles and the 'Subtrack Selection' tool in the 'Boolean groups' to make a crescent moon, working much like the pathfinder tools in illustrator. Making text worked as expected: I simply made a text box and was able to change the font family, type, size and colour as I desired.

We were designing a scrolling website, so I extended the artboard and the background gradient lower.

To prototype how paragraphs would appear on the website, I created 4 text boxes with 'Lorem Ipsum' paragraphs generated by loremipsum.io. On the prototype tab in the sidebar on the right, you can add interactions to particular items: I added an animation so that the site would scroll down to the first paragraph when the bubbles are clicked. I wanted it to be slow rather than intense, so I chose for it to take 3000ms, and chose the "slow" animation style.

Images will be important in our websites, as we are displaying our work on them. There are two ways to add images, one is to just drag the image in, and the other is to create a shape with the shape tool and drag the image into it, so that it appears inside that shape. I made a circle to fit in with the bubbles, and put a photo of me in it.

Unfortunately, I ran into a problem with my program wherein my bubbles were appearing darker in prototype mode (which is the mode which lets you preview your website). I found out this was because the inner shadows in the bubbles weren't rendering properly, but I couldn't figure out how to fix it.

# Drafting Portfolio

## Self reflection paragraphs

We were first instructed for homework to create a series of paragraphs which reflect our work and progress over the semester, based on our self reflection questions.

Across this semester, I have worked on projects in a number of mediums including digital video, interactive web design and digital environments. I have used elements and principles in video editing, design, audio and navigation to realise the intended meanings and emotive qualities behind these projects. 

Using the principles of video editing and audio, and skills in Adobe Premiere, I created a video self-portrait, *i*, which conveyed who I am sech as my introverted nature and my interest in design, art and music. I shot imagery that symbolised introversion, such as tea pouring into a cup, and imagery that symbolised my interests, such as a guitar neck. I highlighted my interest in design and art by carefully composing these shots, drawing attention to this through match cuts which highlighted my use of shapes and motion. I used audio to materialise some of the visuals, such as including the sound of tea pouring, and used audio to elicit intended emotions in the viewer, such as my use of calming music. I also used techniques such as j-cuts and l-cuts, with an l-cut used where a clock ticking sound continues after the last shot, conveying change over time.

Using the elements and principles of design and audio, and skills in Adobe Illustrator, HTML and Javascript, I created a series of buttons for an RPG video game, *Project: Dreamweaver". As this game was dream themed, and was to have a stylised look and a psychedelic steampunk aesthetic, while adhering to the "flat design" language, I had to undergo a number of experiments and ideations. Initially, I thumnailed some ideas for symbols which could represent functions in the games while also representing dreams and the steampunk aesthetic, such as midcentury items or cogs. In addition, I tried different colour schemes, settling on an analogous colour scheme of deep blues and purples to represent dreams, and chose a jagged swirl background over a regular swirl for the icons, to reinforce the stylised look. I used sounds to materialise some of the icons, such as a reloading sound for the gun icon, and used sounds to evoke emotions for others, such as a psychedelic sound effect for the "dream machine" icon.

Using the principles of space and navigation, and skills in Unity and C#, I created a digital environment, *Blossom*, based on my own journey into adulthood. I developed this project over several stages of prototyping and testing, ensuring that the user was interacting with and navigating with the environment in the ways I intended. This is another layer of consideration for this medium, as unlike flat video the user can control the camera however they like. I initally developed a greybox prototype, demonstrating and testing how I would use navigational principles. For instance, I used   spiral paths to make the player navigate around the trees, which they could water with a watering can, before following the central straight path up a hill. I used audio to help the user to navigate towards the trees with a pinging sound, but also to help materialise the environment with ambient nature sounds and materialise actions such as picking up the watering can. I also used audio to evoke a nostalgic mood and a sense of change through a meloncholic soundtrack which dynamically evolved depending on the player's moveement. Playtesting from volunteers was helpful for this project, with feedback such as screen recordings and surveys helping me determine where I was and wasn't successful. For instance, I had to make it more clear that my game was about entering adulthood and nostalgia, after playtesters didn't notice this, by adding a final tree at the end which grew flowers and fruit, and a window/archway view where everything was greyscale. 

## Practicing Figma

We were tasked to use some images and quotes from the documentation we identified in the last homework session, and use this to practice implementing content on Figma. I tried to base this on the sketches I did in the [last post](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s1). 

First I made a main page without any of the content, inside a Desktop sized artboard. I made text boxes and experimented with some fonts that could help me achieve my intention of a playful, stylised look.

I created some "cards", which contained information (the images and quotes I sourced from the blog), each demonstrating one of my assignments. The cards were made with the shape tool, dragging on the corners of the rectangles and the images to curve the edges.

I found a widget to play YouTube videos, which I added in a card under the original Assignment 1 card, displaying my final video for that assignment.

I set all of the elements to "scroll with parent" in the prototype tab except for my name, which I had keeping in place while the user scrolls, as an icon in the corner.

## Drafting Designer Bio

For homework, we were tasked with writing a first draft of our designer bio. Here is mine:

"Jack Reed is a Melbourne based digital media designer and audio engineer. While he specialises in sound design, Jack's digital media experience is wide ranging, including video editing, digital environment design, UI/UX design and web design. With an overarching fantastical flair, his work tends to feature stylised graphics and illustrations, as well as psychedelic and experimental sound design. Jack also has extensive experience in sound production and audio engineering, working with an eclectic range of Melbourne musicians, from indie rockers *The Noise* to R'n'B talent *Sharaz Cavernet*"

Along with this, we have been tasked with what visual elements I can use to express my tastes as a designer. Some of the ideas I have so far are:

* Vibrant, psychedelic, dreamy colours (Deep blues and purples)
* By contrast, I do like very clean designs: white with serif fonts. See the album package for *A Ghost Is Born* by Wilco for example:

![agib1](https://i0.wp.com/dnadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/07/5889-max.jpg)
* Illustrative designs, I love intricate linework:

* Bold fonts. I love classic, bold wide fonts (such as Stretch Pro without the stretching feature) and more unique fonts like perfora:

* Motion design. This might be hard to achieve in a figma prototype, but I love the use of motion graphics in a web design.
* Gradients. I think these can help convey my taste for more fantastical and stylised looking things, but I feel they can look outdated if used in some ways: ie. early 2000s 'aqua' interfaces like early OSX. I like gradients in use cases such as in my figma practice from in class:
![pintoflager](/w10s2/6.png)
* I am a big fan of [M/M Paris](https://www.instagram.com/mmparisdotcom) in terms of design, and would be interested in mirroring aspects of their design ie. typography, illustrations, colours. Some of their work:
