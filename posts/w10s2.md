# Figma Basics

In class, we learned the basic functions of Figma, such as creating artboards, shapes, gradients, text and prototype interactions and animations. These are the main things that we will need to know to use the application to make our portfolio website for Assignment 3. 

Figma works similarly to Adobe Illustrator, with very similar tools. For instance, the program uses artboards. In Figma, you can choose to make artboards the size of the screens you are designing for. Here, I have three desktop sized artboards and 3 iPhone 13/14 sized artboards. Having multiple of each is an effective way to trial different designs and compare them side by side.

I used the shape tool to create a rectangle the size of the artboard and a circle, and used the fill option to fill them with gradients. There is an option to add effects to objects, so I added drop shadows and inner shadows to the circle and gave it a large blur and spread to make it look like a 3D bubble. Command+D as expected allowed me to duplicate this, and I was able to scale them uniformly on all axes by transforming them while holding shift. I used two circles and the 'Subtrack Selection' tool in the 'Boolean groups' to make a crescent moon, working much like the pathfinder tools in illustrator. Making text worked as expected: I simply made a text box and was able to change the font family, type, size and colour as I desired.

We were designing a scrolling website, so I extended the artboard and the background gradient lower.

To prototype how paragraphs would appear on the website, I created 4 text boxes with 'Lorem Ipsum' paragraphs generated by loremipsum.io. On the prototype tab in the sidebar on the right, you can add interactions to particular items: I added an animation so that the site would scroll down to the first paragraph when the bubbles are clicked. I wanted it to be slow rather than intense, so I chose for it to take 3000ms, and chose the "slow" animation style.

Images will be important in our websites, as we are displaying our work on them. There are two ways to add images, one is to just drag the image in, and the other is to create a shape with the shape tool and drag the image into it, so that it appears inside that shape. I made a circle to fit in with the bubbles, and put a photo of me in it.

Unfortunately, I ran into a problem with my program wherein my bubbles were appearing darker in prototype mode (which is the mode which lets you preview your website). I found out this was because the inner shadows in the bubbles weren't rendering properly, but I couldn't figure out how to fix it.
