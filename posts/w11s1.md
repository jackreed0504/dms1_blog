# Classwork

In class, we were tasked with recreating a wireframe for a website from our memory. A wireframe is a basic prototype for a website that only includes basic shapes which indicate the layout of elements. For instance, boxes may represent text or shapes, and boxes with an X inside may represent images. This task is helpful as it gets us used to the task of wireframing, and draws our attention to our 'blind spots', the elements we may have forgotten to include while creating our wireframe from memory, that may be crucial elements we should avoid overlooking in our future web design. 

The site I chose to recreate was Pitchfork. I used the shape tool in Figma to create rectangles, with a black stroke on each, representing the text and other shapes in the design, and used the line tool to create crosses which designated images. I made the rectangle with a cross an Asset so I could quickly recreate it.

My final design was not correct, however I think it was a combination of the current and a slightly older Pitchfork layout.

The older layout in question:

The current layout:

We were then instructed to look at the actual website and then recreate it. I ended up changing the colours of the rectangles to make the elements more distinct:

# Homework

We were instructed for homework to create some wireframe iterations of our portfolio. 

For my first one, I experimented with using the Golden Ratio to see if it would help me make the page look more aesthetically pleasing. I started by making a desktop-sized artboard, and then scaling it lengthwise to fit other elements below to scroll to. I made "cards" for each of my projects and bio.

For the next one, I tried having half the page filled with a block colour and text, and the other half filled with images, and having them switch sides for each project. For the last one, I brought back the "cards", made the text more central and brough in a line which continues down the site, in order to evoke M/M Paris's often illustrative style that I [previously noted as a potential influence](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s2).

I think having the text central as in the last design, rather than at opposing corners was more successful, as having text at opposing ends may not make the focal point of the website upon opening, my name, as clear for the user. I however do prefer having the logo in the corner while the user is scrolling through the cards, as in the first design is a good idea, as it keeps the branding/my name constantly in view. I think the cards with their curved edges in the first and last are a more playful design which is what i wanted to evoke as [stated in the last blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s2), as it should remind the user of my stylised visuals and taste in design. By contrast, the hard edges in the second design look professional and sleek. The second design contains a circular badge at the bottom, which I intend to be an indicator saying "scroll down". I think this will be helpful for the user to navigate the site, as it may not be clear that they need to scroll without it, so I will keep it in my final wireframe. Lastly, while I think having some sort of illustration in the background might be interesting to experiment with, and an effective way to evoke my taste for stylised visuals and my M/M Paris inspiration, for now it appears to look too busy to have the line as in the third design, so I will not continue with that for my final wireframe. 

Considering those refinements, I have constructed a final wireframe for the portfolio:
