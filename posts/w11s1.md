# Classwork

In class, we were tasked with recreating a wireframe for a website from our memory. A wireframe is a basic prototype for a website that only includes basic shapes which indicate the layout of elements. For instance, boxes may represent text or shapes, and boxes with an X inside may represent images. This task is helpful as it gives us pracitice in wireframing, which we will use to plan the layouts of our website. Furthermore, it draws our attention to our 'blind spots', the elements we may have forgotten to include while creating our wireframe from memory. These could be crucial elements we should avoid overlooking in our future web design. 

The site I chose to recreate was the Pitchfork homepage. I used the shape tool in Figma to create rectangles, with a black stroke on each, representing the text and other shapes, and used the line tool to create crosses which designated images. I made the rectangle with a cross an Asset, so I could quickly recreate it.

My final design was not correct, however I think it was a combination of the current and a slightly older Pitchfork layout.

The older layout in question:

The current layout:

We were then instructed to look at the actual website and then recreate it. I ended up changing the colours of the rectangles to make the elements more distinct:

# Homework

For homework, we were instructed to create some wireframe iterations of our portfolio. 

For my first one, I experimented with using the Golden Ratio to see if it would help me make the page look more aesthetically pleasing. I didn't find it made my layout any stronger than the others I did below. I started by making a desktop-sized artboard, and then scaling it lengthwise to make it scrollable. I made "cards" for each of my projects and bio.

For the next one, I considered having half the page filled with a block colour and text, and the other half filled with images, and having these elements alternate sides for each project. For the last one, I brought back the "cards", made the text more central and brough in a line which continues down the site, in order to evoke M/M Paris's often illustrative style that I [previously noted as a potential influence](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s2).

I think having the logo central as in the last design, rather than at opposing corners was more successful, as the logo would be a stronger focal point if it was central. I do however think having the logo in the corner while the user is scrolling through the cards, like the first design is a good idea, as it keeps the branding/my name constantly in view. I think the cards with their curved edges in the first and last are a more playful design which is what i wanted to evoke as [stated in the last blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s2), as it should remind the user of my stylised visuals and taste in design. By contrast, the hard edges in the second design look professional and sleek. The second design contains a circular badge at the bottom, which I intend to be an indicator saying "scroll down". I think this will be helpful for the user to navigate the site, as it may not be clear that they need to scroll without it, so I will keep it in my final wireframe. While I think having some sort of illustration in the background might be interesting to experiment with, and an effective way to evoke my taste for stylised visuals, having the line in the third wireframe makes it too busy, so I will not continue with that for my final wireframe. 

Considering those refinements, I have constructed a final wireframe for the portfolio:
