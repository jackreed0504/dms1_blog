# Classwork

In class we learned about the Grid System in web design which is used to make web design more accessible, ensuring designs are consistent and balanced so that they are easier to adapt to different screen sizes. This is done using a number of columns, most commonly 12, with each element on the website fitting within a certain number of those columns. This can be done in Figma using the Layout Grid option and setting it to columns.

In class, we were tasked with finding the desktop and mobile versions of 2 websites and trying to find their application of the grid system, by using the Layout grid and changing the column count, column width and column margin until the elements fit. I managed to do this successfully for the Pitchfork website and the dashboard page for my Athletics club:

I did, however struggle to do this for the mobile versions of these sites. This is most obvious in the Pitchfork site, where the "three-lines" menu icon on the left and the search icon on the right aren't equal distances from the edge. Not all websites follow the grid layout, and for these sites this is most likely the case.

# Homework

## Grid Layout

For homework, we were tasked with revisiting our websites and considering how they could be improved with a grid layout. I looked at my wireframe for the desktop version of my website and tried applying the grid layout. I felt like this helped me make the layout more balanced, with elements such as the images and the text taking up a more equal amount of the composition. Furthermore, it helped me judge the space between items in a more consistent way, so none of the measurements looked out of place with eachother, and the cards looked less claustrophobic.

## Implementing content

I began to implement the content into the site, keeping the grid overlay turned on for now incase of the text changing size. I implemented my title, for which I used the font Perfora, which has a unique appearance inspired by punch-holes and paper cut-outs, and I used bright pastel colours to reflect the 'playful' style I mentioned before. This evokes my taste as a designer, and the use of a unique font and bright colours is inspired by M/M paris who I [previously noted as an influence](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s2). The bright and vibrant colours also evoke the psychedelic style which I wanted to evoke. I kept the background plain dark grey to keep the design fairly minimal, as while many of my influences lean towards maximalism, I am very influenced by minimal designs; [I referenced the package for Wilco's A Ghost Is Born as an influence](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s2). The combination of these two elements should display that as a designer, while I like to use playful and stylised visuals, I enjoy sleek and minimalist designs. I used the Adobe Colour website to generate the colour pallete I used. I had another version of my "logo" above the first card as a logo which follows you through the website, on one line to save horizontal space in the website while keeping the font size large and readable. It is inside a text box but on the second line, so that when I set it to "Sticky" (stick to the top of the screen) in the prototype settings, there is a gap at the top of the page. I also added a grey rectangle behind it which also sticks to the top, so that the text doesn't go over the cards when scrolling. I did end up changing the column weight and margin to account for the text being added in. I made a 'scroll down' button/indicator using the triangle shape tool (and curving the edges) and a similarly bold font to my name, that was more readable but fairly consistent in weight to the title font. Next, I began implementing the information about the individual projects. I used the same font as the one used for my name for the project titles. I initially tried the different colours which were used for my name, but settled on the background grey colour to ensure their readability. I used a more simple sans-serif font for the body text, in black and size 20px (the suggested minimum is 16) to ensure that it was accessible and readable. Lastly, I implemented my images of the projects into the cards.

I used the prototype/interact settings for the "scroll down" button and the second "logo" to add "On Click" behaviours, so they would scroll: clicking the "scroll down" button scrolls to the grey rectangle so as to view the first card in the center of the screen, and clicking the second logo scrolls to an invisible rectangle at the top of the whole design to take the user back to the start.

I copied the elements to a new iPhone 13/14 sized frame and ordered them to fit the mobile desktop. I decided not to use the grid layout, as this was a scrolling website for mobile and I felt that the elements would be experienced in a verticle order, rather than having multiple elements in one horizintal line. This is how I noticed the two websites I analyzed in the class task before worked, and I feel it is appropriate as the phone screen is much less wide and can fit less information horizontally. I changed some of the font sizes to be smaller, but I found out later that I made the body text below the reccomended 16px for body text size. One thing I found useful while doing this was the ability to preview my site in the Figma app on my phone and see the edits in real time. This helped me for the second "logo", which initially sat right under the notch on my phone with no gap, but I was able to move the logo down and see its effect in real time.

## Accessibility

I ran the Contrast Checker plugin in my Figma project, which checks if your project adheres to the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guide) standards in use of contrast. This ensures that the text colour and brightness are set in a way which makes them easily visible and legible for users. My project adhered to the guidelines according to the plugin.

![10](/w11s2/10.png)

I found out that the font size for the body text in the mobile version of my website was 15px, although the recommended is 16px, so I changed this and rearranged the elements accordingly. The most common feedback from family and friends was that the font I chose for the "logo" was not very legible. The font has multiple weights, and the smaller ones have more defined shapes, so I switched to a smaller weight which made it much easier to read.

## Writing

My artist statements were not quite concise enough, so I have attempted to lower the word count while making the expression more effective.

### Assignment 1 ("i")

*i* is a self-portrait, realised through the medium of digital video, though it rarely depicts me in person. Using my smartphone camera, I captured footage which evoked parts of my personality, such as my introversion and my passion for design, art and music. A vinyl record needle being dropped, tea being poured into a mug, the wavering oscillations of guitar strings and more are conjured into a montage, floating along to a fingerstyle guitar piece which I wrote for the project. The visual and auditory experiences coallesce to form a mosaic of myself, exposing my personality to the viewer.

### Assignment 2 ("Project: Dreamweaver")

*Project: Dreamweaver* is a classic psychedelic RPG game about a mad scientist with a ramshackle machine which lets him enter people's dreams and defeat the monsters giving them nightmares. I created a suite of buttons for this game which capture the game's quirky, steampunk-influenced world and fun, stylised art-style. A colour scheme of dreamy, deep blues, and the motif of a jagged spiral shape capture its stylised and dreamy aesthetic. Icons depicting midcentury objects, like old fashioned suitcases evoke game's steampunk style. Others represent the dream concept using symbols like moons. Basic white shapes form the central icons, giving them an accessible, modern simplicity. 

### Assignment 3 ("Blossom")

*Blossom* is a digital environment which explores the growth and the introspection I experienced during my transition into becoming an adult. I was influenced by the games ÅŒkami, for its growing and changing environments, and Minecraft for its meloncholic soundtrack. At first dominated by a large metal entrance, the player finishes on a tall mountain overlooking the world, as the soundtrack dynamically evolves. Using a watering can, the player can grow bare trees into verdant ones, the final one blossoming with flowers and fruit. However, the lofi production of the soundtrack evokes feelings of meloncholy and nostalgia, and by the end, the player overlooks landscape through a greyscale window into the past.

### Designer Bio

"Jack Reed is a Melbourne based digital media designer and audio engineer. While he specialises in sound design, Jack's digital media experience is wide ranging, including video editing, digital environment design, UI/UX design and web design.
