# Classwork

Figma offers some features for collaboration, such as the ability to invite others to your project so they can view, edit, and add comments. In class, we were tasked with inviting our classmates to our project for feedback. This allows us to recieve feedback to potentially improve our designs, and highlight some possible blind spots in accessibility. People ended up giving me their feedback to me in person.

Some of the feedback I recieved was:

* The body text could use more leading to make it easier to read
* I could use animations with components to make the website look more professional
* The body text could look more "square" to match the headers

# Homework

## Website

For homework, we were tasked with implementing the rest of the content into our website, while making adjustments based on the feedback we recieved in class. I increased the leading on the body text to make it easier to read, as suggested. This made the text boxes too big for the cards, but the text for the desktop site was 20px while the minimum reccomended is 16px. I changed the body text to 16px, and the text boxes fit better.

I tried making the text square, but I felt this was "tacky", as it meant I was using a similar, gimicky element too much throughout the design. Furthermore, it detracted from the minimalism I was aiming for. I asked some other members of the class, and most agreed that the square text was unnecessary.

While I hadn't been given feedback in regards to this, I felt like the fact that the corner radius of the cards and images was different to the title text font was making the design inconsistent. I made a rectangle with the shape tool and placed it against the title, adjusting the corner radius until it was the same. I applied this radius to both the cards and the images. I decided to try having the image look like it was filling up one side of the card, by placing a white rectangle over the left side to hide the curved corners (in retrospect, a better way to do this was probably by placing the image in the 'card' shape, and selecting the "crop" option to move it in the shape). I think this made the design look cleaner and less busy, by eliminating some distracting shapes. This also helped in achieving my desired minimalist look. I turned the column overlay back on when arranging these to ensure my design was balanced and accessible.

I wanted to express my taste for stylised and illustrative art more throughout the website, as well as my influences such as M/M Paris. In the [blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w11s1) where I document creating my wireframes, I discussed potentially featuring illustrations in the site to achieve this. I considered some of my inspirations which I highlighted in another [blog post](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s2). I liked how M/M Paris tend to heavily feature illustrated linework in their work, and how the album package for A Ghost Is Born by Wilco features bizzarre, stylised illustrations.

To replicate these styles, I decided to make an alternate version of the website logo, that would change when the user hovers over it. This would add some animation into the website as suggested (though I will animate other elements like the buttons later). This version of the logo is made up of cartoony, stylised doodles. I did this by duplicating my desktop frame, and adding an interaction that would switch the overlay to the second version when the user hovers over the logo. In the second overlay, I filled the logo up with completely random stylised doodles using my Wacom, and then deleted the original logo.

To make the entire design more consistent with this new addition, I copied some of the illustrations, made them black and put them on the sides of the cards.

## Blog

Our second homework task was to revisit our blog tasks and make sure the blog is as accessible and as professional as possible. I went through and made sure my writing was concise, fixing problems with expression that made it unclear. I also ensured that images were placed in a way that was not messy, and that I was using headers in a clear way. I checked that the layout fit the standards for accessibility. As the background is white and the text is black, there is enough contrast in the blog.
