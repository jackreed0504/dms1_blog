Our only homework task for this session was to finish Assignment 4. 

I implemented some of my sound production/engineering work into some additional cards in the site. I added headers for "Design Work" and "Music Work" to clarify the distinction between these two sections. These headers used style and colours based on the logo to make the design consistent. As the website was getting long, I created a menu, using the same font and colour scheme, to help the user navigate the site. Using the Interact 'On Click' and 'Scroll To' functions, the names of each section navigates to an invisible rectangle above the intended card, so that the card is centered on screen. I made the animation 1200ms, so it was fairly smooth without being slow. As you can also see in these screenshots, I used rectangles to measure the distance between elements and ensure they were consistent.

I added a contact form which I found in the 'Assets/Widgets' menu. I added this, as in a [previous blogpost](https://jackreed050-dms1-blog-55.deno.dev/w10s1), I had written that the target audience might want to see contact details on the site. I edited the form so that the fonts and colours matched the rest of the site for consistency.

I realised that the user had no way of accessing the projects, so I created a button, same shape, colour and font to the scroll down button for consistency, that links to the project. I did this using the Interact menu, and adding an On Click interaction that opens a given link.

At this point, I realised I was doing animations incorrectly. I had different frames for my animations, such as the illustrated logo, that would open as overlays. The correct way to do animations is with Components. You create an object, select it and Right Click > Create Component. Then you press Create Variant in properties, which creates a duplicate of the object. You apply the change to this duplicate, and use the interact options to designate what makes them change. If you choose the smart animate option, this generally creates a smooth animation. 

I created an animation for the Scroll Down button this way, so that the yellow circle would get larger when the user hovers over it. I had to replace the original Scroll Down button with the component.

Next, I recreated the main logo as a component, making the illustrated version a variant and using the interact options to make them switch (Change To - Variant 2) when the user hovers over.

I recreated the navigation menu items as components, adding variants of each where the text colour was white. I set them each in the interact options to "Change To" the white variant when the user hovers over them.

I also did this for the buttons to open the links, and the floating Jack Reed logo, so they would get larger when the user hovers over.

I began translating my new changes to the mobile version. While making any changes, I mirrored my document on my phone using the Figma Mirroring feature, so I could ensure everything was working on mobile. I kept the vertical cards I previously had in the mobile version, as content on mobile is consumed vertically. I gave the cards the same corner radius as the desktop ones. I also added the illustrations, placing them at the top where there was enough space. I set the text to align center, as I previously had it aligning left which looked inconsistent with the vertical design. I ended up needing to make new versions of the components, as when I dragged my desktop components in, I often wasn't able to scale them down. In addition, I needed to change the animations to happen "On Press", rather than "On Hover", as you cannot hover on mobile.

I found that often when animations would happen, even if they were set to happen "While Pressing" rather than "On Click", they would be stuck. I added a "Delay" interaction on the second variation of all the buttons, so that they would switch back after a set amount of time

As with the desktop version, I used invisible rectangles for "Scroll To" interactions, so the cards would be centered when scrolled to via buttons.
