In class for Week 2 Session 1, we were instructed to create storyboards for an already existing scene. My storyboard is based on the Sutekh reveal in the recent Doctor Who season finale. This was a particularly bad choice for an activity that was just for practice, as it is quite repetitive and packed with content and took a long time to complete. The activity nonetheless helped me learn what key things to capture in a storyboard and its notes, such as characters, setting, sound and movement. Furthermore, it has helped me realise that I will make future storyboards (such as the one for my assignment) using either an ipad or pen and paper, as the trackpad was very slow and difficult to use.
