# Storyboard In-Class Task

In class for Week 2 Session 1, we were instructed to create storyboards for an already existing scene. My storyboard is based on the Sutekh reveal in the recent Doctor Who season finale. This was a particularly bad choice for an activity that was just for practice, as it is quite repetitive and packed with content and took a long time to complete. The activity nonetheless helped me learn what key things to capture in a storyboard and its notes, such as characters, setting, sound and movement. Furthermore, it has helped me realise that I will make future storyboards (such as the one for my assignment) using either an ipad or pen and paper, as the trackpad was very slow and difficult to use.

# Assignment Storyboard

For homework, we were instructed to create a storyboard for our first assignment (Self-Portrait film). My work will maintain continuity in the form of visual continuity, as I plan to group together similar shapes and environments as seen in the storyboard.  The editing of this film will use the visual continuity to express my interest in and attention to design and art. I will display temporal continuity by ending the film with images of growth into adulthood (such as the P plates).
