In the homework task for this session, we were instructed to pick a key moment in our film and justify how we plan to use audio for this moment. The moment which I decided on is the first few shots, which feature a needle dropping on a vinyl record, a cup of tea being poured and food being stirred in a pan, focusing on their similar shapes and slow movements. 

The emotional tone of the self-portrait will be calm, capturing my introspective nature. As the needle drops onto the record, I will use a sound effect of vinyl crackling, a sound which is often associated with nostalgia and simplicity, in order to reflect the intended 'calm' emotion. I will write a calm acoustic guitar track with a soft, unobtrusive drum track to accompany the film, in order to further express this. I want the audience to be drawn to the soft, circular shapes shared across these images and the slow movements to reinforce the 'calm' feeling. I believe the tone of the sound effects and music will assist with this. I will ensure the shots are edited on-beat with the music, which will have a slow tempo, to create a relaxing feeling in their presentation. I am considering writing the piece in 3/4 time to generate a 'breezy' feeling.
