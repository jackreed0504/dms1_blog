# Key-Moment

In the homework task for this session, we were instructed to pick a key moment in our film and justify how we plan to use audio for this moment. The moment which I decided on is the first few shots, which feature a needle dropping on a vinyl record, a cup of tea being poured and food being stirred in a pan, focusing on their similar shapes and slow movements. This task is valuable as it provokes us to consider and plan for our use of audio in the video, and it gives us practice in understanding the effect of audio in achieving the emotional and conceptual intention of a video project.

# Storyboard with Audio

The emotional tone of the self-portrait will be calm, capturing my introspective nature. As the needle drops onto the record, I will use a sound effect of vinyl crackling, a sound which is often associated with nostalgia and simplicity, in order to reflect the intended 'calm' emotion. I will write a calm acoustic guitar track with a soft, unobtrusive drum track to accompany the film, in order to further express this. I want the audience to be drawn to the soft, circular shapes shared across these images and the slow movements to reinforce the 'calm' feeling. I believe the tone of the sound effects and music will assist with this. I will ensure the shots are edited on-beat with the music, which will have a slow tempo, to create a relaxing feeling in their presentation. I am considering writing the piece in 3/4 time to generate a 'breezy' feeling. I want to try having a point where the music cuts out and is replaced by tactile 'asmr' sounds to represent what is happening in the scene, as they would convey a 'relaxing' feeling. I don't plan on using any other sounds at this point, but may experiment if this isn't effective (the lack of materiality might be a problem).
