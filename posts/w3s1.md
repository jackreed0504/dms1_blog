In class, we were instructed to take videos following a selection of themes in groups. We then individually took another groups video and chose audio which would either reinforce or subvert the intended theme. I chose to subvert the intended theme of the video I chose, which was an escape, by placing comedic and lighthearted music over.

I also decided to add some sound effects from adobe's "cartoon" sound effects in their royalty free library. I used a comedic sound effect of a man saying "help" to do this, further subverting the intention of the film.

The final product is below:

For homework we were instructed to create a draft for our self-portrait assignment, to show in class for feedback next session. I started by selecting the best footage in the Premiere media browser, and putting it over the music and the vinyl crackle, placing the footage in time with the beat.

As seen in the below picture, I had the music briefly low pass the music in one scene where the footage goes black, then featured a light switch sound (from the footage) as the light comes on, while simultaneously the lowpass dissapears.

I decided to move the CD Walkman to the end of the film, using the sound of the player opening from the footage to signal the end of the film. This bookends the scene with the opening with the vinyl record needle drop (symbolising growth and change.)
