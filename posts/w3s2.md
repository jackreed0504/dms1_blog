In class, we were instructed to post our drafts to Discord, where we would watch eachothers videos and provide feedback. This task was very valuable as seeing how my classmates approached the self portrait inspired me to consider different ways to approach mine. Furthermore, I recieved some great feedback which I took on board in my final cut. Firstly, I was told my video could be improved with more audio to materialise the footage. I added the tea pouring sound captured with the footage and used a j-cut to draw attention to the match cut between it and the vinyl record and make the cut more natural. I also added a royalty free clock ticking sound under the footage of the clock, and used an l cut to continue it over the CD walkman and to continue after the footage ends, to symbolise time passing and change.

As my footage was quite shakey, it was suggested that I use Premiere's Warp Stabiliser. I applied this to many of the shots and reshot some of the others which were less salvagable.
