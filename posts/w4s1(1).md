In class, we were instructed to do the "Black Box Activity", which involved creating a series of small designs to reflect particular concepts in Adobe Illustrator, with the constraint of only using four black squares in each design. Out of the eight designs for each concept, we would select the strongest one, and duplicate and enlarge it as seen below. 

This was a useful activity as it helped us familiarise ourselves with the functions of Adobe Illustrator; I used the Rectangle tool, dragging while holding shift to create each of the black squares, used the selection tool to select and resize and rotate the square (while holding shift) and used the "Option+Drag" command to duplicate the squares. 

The task also helped us familiarize ourself with the "Design Thinking" Process (**Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test**). The **Empathize** section of design thinking involves understanding the client/audience, their needs and how to communicate with them, and the **Define** section involves clearly defining these needs and constraints. The needs of this task were to create designs which expressed 6 different concepts, while the constraints were that they could only be composed using 4 black squares. The **Ideate** section involves generating ideas, such as in a mind map, and the **Prototype** section involves drafting these ideas, such as in a mockup or thumbnail. We practiced these stages by generating 8 thumbnails for each idea, generating many different solutions to address the concepts.

Lastly, the **Test** stage of design thinking involves reviewing the generated ideas/prototypes and making decisions on which ones work. As seen below, I selected the thumbnails which I believed were most successful for each concept and placed enlarged versions in the larger squares.
