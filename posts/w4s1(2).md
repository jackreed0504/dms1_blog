For homework, we were instructed to create a mind map related to one of the prompts provided, which we will use to inspire our work in Assignment 2. Picking the prompt of "Dreams", I drew connections to every related term, idea, person or thing that came to mind, following each thread to disover new connections. This task is useful as it prompts us to listen to our subconscious, engage in idea generation and think in detail about the prompt. It will be a useful resource to revisit throghout the Design Thinking process, displaying different ideas I can consider and borrow from to generate or enrich ideas in my project. This is part of the **Ideate** section of design thinking.

We were then instructed to describe the context, platform and target audience of our project. This task is integral to the **Empathise** section of design thinking, as we are beginning to understand who our userbase and clientelle will be for this project.

**Context:** My 9 Button Suite will be designed for a videogame UI. This game will be a stylised platformer where the user plays as a "Dream Pirate", who sails a Dream Ship through the sky. In the sky, various portals lead him into people's dreams (the levels of the game), where he has to fight off enemies which torment the dream-haver and give them nightmares. The game will be cartoony, stylised and feature elements of steampunk aesthetics.

**Platform:** I will be designing this for the PC version of the game.

**Target Audience:** Young adults aged in their late teens to early 20s who are interested in indie games. Self-proclaimed "nerd", creative, probably wants to be an animator/game designer. That said, the game is very family friendly and is expected to reach a younger audience, either via shows like GGSP (do people still watch that?) or YouTubers who do Let's Plays of new indie games.
