In class, we were tasked with creating 20 thumbnail sketches for an icon, with a 10 minute time limit. I decided my icon would be a logo for a record store. This task helps us engage in using our subconscious to quickly and unrestrictively generate ideas, (the **ideate** and **prototype** sections of design thinking) and evaluating these designs for our blog familiarises ourselves with the **test** section of design thinking and develops our critical evaluation skills in design.

I hadn't completed the task within the time limit, with only 14 icons. While I definitely could do with some practice in quick idea generation, this is probably mostly due to me changing my idea for what my icon was for during the first few minutes.

I tried playing with several ideas, including literally representing the concept of "crate digging". However, I think combining too many of these ideas made the icons too busy, and confounded the intended message (simply: record store). I like the below idea the most as it depicts the crates in the store (a significant thing in record stores), and the top half of the record being shown effectively shows what is being sold. The icon is simple and not too messy or confusing. It uses rounded edge and circles, so it is softer and more inviting.
