# Research

I looked at games which were dream themed, and games which took on a steampunk aesthetic, taking notes on their visual style and focusing on the UI/icons.

In addition, I took notes in how digital artists/stock asset creators approached "steampunk" style UI design.

I also looked on thenounproject.com for icons that may appear in my project, to get inspiration / take note on a general idea of the common symbols used for these icons.

# Thumbnailing

I came up with the 9 icons which will appear in my assignment, and generated 5 thumbnails per icon.

### Inventory
For the "inventory", I think the best icon was 5. I think the use of the circle surrounding the icon is appropriate as the inventory is a 'friendly' place, as opposed to the outside 'nightmare' world. The swirl (which will be purple) helps convey the "dream" idea and the line draws the viewers eye into the suitcase. The use of form in the suitcase makes the icon stand out. The use of a suitcase rather than a chest reinforces the 'steampunk' idea, using midcentury rather than medieval imagery. I think the worst icon was 4. The use of angular lines and corners make the picture look uninviting for the user to press. In addition, the lack of detail and form would not effectively convey the steampunk style, which often sually uses texture to convey a 'vintage' style.

### Settings 
My favourite thumbnail for "Settings" is 2. The use of multiple gears effectively conveys the technological/mechanical steampunk style, while the gear is associated with the idea of settings. The use of circles invites users to press the button as it is welcoming. My least favourite is 3 as the use of form detracts from the clarity of what is a universal symbol, and makes it too distracting considering the settings are not part of the game itself.

### Activate "Dream Machine"
I think that the most successful thumbnail for the dream machine was 5, as the use of line in the swirl communicates the dream theme and draws the users eye into the moon. The moon is a universal symbol for dreams, which makes it an effective symbolic choice. The circular backdrop makes it more welcoming to the user, which is important as the mechanic of the button is integral to the game. I think the least successful was 4. While the power symbol effectively communicates powering on, as it is a universal symbol, nothing suggests dreaming. The use of mostly only circles in the icon suggests calmness, and doesn't effectively convey the 'action' with pressing the button.

### Equip/Weapon
I think that the best thumbnail for Equip was 1, as the use of triangular and angular lines effectively conveys the action, power and violence associated with weapons. The diagonal lines additionally convey the tense, disorderly nature of battle. I think the worst is 5. The use of the circle, swirl, and the rounded edges of the ray-gun much the opposite of 1, does not convey the violence of battle, instead conveying warmth.

### Menu
I think the best icon for Menu was 3. The use of the 3 lines symbol is universally recognised as a symbol for a 'menu', and the three horizontal lines convey order and stability, which is effective for a menu which should be organized and straightforward. The old tv displaying the symbol conveys the steampunk them, and its rounded edges make it more welcoming to the user. I think the 2nd option is the worst, as the use of form is uneccesary and overcomplicates the clarity of the universal menu symbol.

### Stats
I think the best 'stats' icon was 2, as the old tv communicates the steampunk theme effectively and the rounded edges make it welcoming for the user to press. The graph to represent statistics is fairly universal and the use of diagonal lines represents change, as in the changing nature of the player's stats, and the 'coldness' of this area of the software as opposed to the gameplay. My least favourite was 3, as the prominence of rounded shapes doesn't help communicate the 'factual', 'cold' nature of the statistics, and the image of the flexing muscles isn't a universally recognised symbol for statistics.

### Boss-Fight
I think the best thumbnail for boss fight was 3. The use of zigzagged, angular lines are aggressive and unwelcoming in comparison to the swirls on other icons, helping convey the danger of the fight. In addition, they draw the viewer's eye to the skull in the center, which represents death, helping highlight the danger of the boss-fight. I think the worst thumbnail was 1, as there aren't as many angular lines as the others, relying mostly on circular shapes which give it an innapropriately welcoming feel.

### Access map
My favourite icon for the map was 4, as it is a universal symbol for location, and the rounded edges make it welcoming for the user to press. My least favourite was 2, as the lack of space makes the image busy and overcomplicated rather than effectively communicating the idea. In addition, the scroll imagery doesn't clearly reveal its 'map' purpose.

### Interact
I felt that the best icon for interact was 1, as its angular shape conveys action, effectively telling the user that the given item can be interacted with. By contrast, my least favourite was 5, as the use of circles, while being welcoming, doesn't effectively tell the user that they can take an 'action' in that context. Furthermore, the imagery of spectacles implies inspecting, rather than interacting.
