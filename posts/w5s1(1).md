In class, we were given 3 challenges which helped us familiarise ourselves with the Adobe Illustrator pen tool, and in particular "Bézier curves", which are especially tricky to master.

First we played the "Bézier Game", which gives the user tricky shapes to practice creating Bézier curves using the pen tool. I was quite bad at this, but began to get the hang of it towards the end. The game was thus quite useful for me, as it improved my pen tool skills quite significantly. My score is shown in the screenshot below:

Next, we were given a couple of images to practice our Illustrator skills. I found tracing the letters EPRS, seen below quite straightforward, aside from the S, but after some messing around I discovered that you can hold control and option after placing a corner, allowing you to perfect your bézier curve in post.

We were also given an image of a rabbit to trace and fill using the shape tool and the pen tool. I probably used too many corners with the pen tool as the edges were not quite as smooth as they should have been, however by this point I believe I was fairly well acquainted with the pen tool.
