# Designing Icons

I began designing my icons based on the sketches, using flat design as per the brief. This Addresses the **Prototype** section of design thinking, as I was beginning to develop samples of the icons. This task helped us develop our technical skills in Illustrator, and begins the process of creating the icons in our assignment.

I picked a shade of purple and created an analogous colour scheme using, Google's Adobe Colour tool, which I used for my initial designs of 4 icons. Each icon had a circle in the background with a swirl, to evoke the 'psychedelic' dream theme. I created the circle with the shape tool (holding shift to make it a perfect circle), and initally created the swirl with the pen tool for a cartoony effect (as seen in my 'Psychonauts' inspiration), though I changed this later to simplify it in the sensibilities of flat design. With all of the icons, I used Illustrator's alignment tools to make sure everything was centered and neat.

I used the shape tool to create all of both of the icons. I used the Direct Selection tool to transform the sides of the suitcase (which I created with the rectangle tool), to create a '3D' perspective effect. To create the gaps in the sides of the suitcase, the line through the middle, the clips and the handle I used the 'outline stroke' feature and the pathfinder tool. An early attempt was quite wonky, which I tried intentionally to evoke a 'cartoony' look but didn't continue with, to focus on a more 'simplistic' look to address the flat design constraint.

I also used the circle tool and the rectangle tool for the cogs for the settings, using 'outline stroke' and the pathfinder to create the holes in the cogs.

I experimented a little bit with subtle gradients in interest of emulating the aspects I liked of the 'Psychonauts' inspiration, but I didn't use these for the time being to focus on using the 'flat design' language. I began creating a skull using the Circle tool, and flattening one side with the 'direct selection' tool.

I added a rectangle, using the option to round the corners and four smaller rectangles with rounded corners for the teeth, and used Illustrator's smart guides to line them up with the rest of the skull. I created a small circle and used the direct selection tool to flatten the side, creating an 'angry eye'. I duplicated and flipped it, and used the pathfinder tool to cut them out of the skull so the background could be seen. I also created an exclaimation mark icon with the circle tool and a rounded triangle (which I created with the polygon tool set to "3 sides") but I forgot to screenshot the creation.

I replaced my intentionally 'wonky' swirl with a perfect one using the swirl tool, to make sure I was adhering to the simplicity of flat design. I used the Illustrator "Width" tool to make sure the stroke was wider towards the edge, and thinner down the centre. I used the Pathfinder tool to make sure the swirl was cut off at the edge of the circle.

# Colour Theory

For homework, we were tasked with creating colour designs for four different icons, which had to include a monochromatic pallete, analogous pallete, split complementary pallete and triadic pallete. This addressed the **prototype** and **test** sections of design thinking, as it is a continution of the creation of my icon 'mockups', and I evaluated the success of each colour pallette afterwards. This task helps us develop our understanding and practice of applying colour theory, and the development of our critical judgement in design. I created the colour palletes I used in the Adobe Colour webapp.

### Evaluation

While the 'split complementary' colour pallette helped the icons stand out from the 'swirl' backgrounds through the use of a complementary colour on each icon, I felt like the colour scheme was too complex for the 'simplicity' of flat design, and in my opinion looked unnapealing and tacky (particularly in the skull, I didn't mind the other three). The 'triadic' colour scheme gave me the opportunity to experiment with more of a bronze colour for the icons, which I initially thought might help express the 'steampunk' element of my project, but I found these colours together unnapealing and they lacked contrast, making the icons blend into the background. Futhermore, the colour scheme was also quite complex which is innapropriate for the 'flat design' language. With the 'analogous' and 'monochromatic' pallettes, I used white for the icons, which I think successfully adds contrast while keeping the colour scheme simplistic and minimal. I liked both the 'monochromatic' and 'analogous' ones the most for this reason. I liked the analogous one the most, partially because the colours I chose for the pallete were brighter/vibrant, making them feel more 'psychedelic' which I felt helped with the 'dream' theme. Having more colour options also reinforced this, and let me try different colour styles between buttons while keeping a consistency between them. For instance, I thought making the settings blue would distinguish it as a system button as opposed to ingame buttons like the 'interact' and 'inventory' buttons. 

Using my favourite 'analagous' colour design, I experimented again with the gradients and the wonky spiral as seen below. This is how I would like my final designs to look.
