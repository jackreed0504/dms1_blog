## Icon Designs
Continuing the **Prototype** stage of Design thinking, I completed prototypes for the rest of the icons, including the weapons, map, stats, menu, and 'activate dream machine' buttons, now with additional knowledge of Design Principals and the Pathfinder tool. The weapons button/pistol, which I did first, was particularly tricky and took me a while to do due to my relative inexperience with Illustrator. I took some liberties with the time I took for this particular icon as I was isolating with COVID and had nothing better to do.

### Pistol
I downloaded a reference for "steampunk gun" from google images and based my icon on this, copying the basic shapes using the Illustrator "Shape" tools, pathfinder tools and the Direct selection tool to modify them in different ways. For instance, the below image features two rectangles, joined together with circles using the pathfinder "unite" tool to create the barrel of the pistol. I modified the circular end to make it slightly flatter, matching the reference using the direct selection tool.

I made outlines for certain parts, such as below, using the "outline stroke" option and the "minus front" pathfinder tool. The below shapes were created using the "unite" pathfinder tool to join the rectangle and circle.

The more complex shapes, such as the grip and the trigger, were created using the pen tool, exercising the skills I had learnt in using BÃ©zier curves earlier in the week.

Initially the pistol looked somewhat inconsistent against the other icons due to the outlines being quite a bit thinner, so I applied a larger stroke, which I used in conjunction with the "minus front" pathfinder tool to enlargen the outlines.
