## Icon Designs
Continuing the **Prototype** stage of Design thinking, I completed prototypes for the rest of the icons, including the weapons, map, stats, menu, and 'activate dream machine' buttons, now with additional knowledge of Design Principals and the Pathfinder tool. The weapons button/pistol, which I did first, was particularly tricky and took me a while to do due to my relative inexperience with Illustrator. I took some liberties with the time I took for this particular icon as I was isolating with COVID and had nothing better to do.

### Pistol
I downloaded a reference for "steampunk gun" from google images and based my icon on this, copying the basic shapes using the Illustrator "Shape" tools, pathfinder tools and the Direct selection tool to modify them in different ways. For instance, the below image features two rectangles, joined together with circles using the pathfinder "unite" tool to create the barrel of the pistol. I modified the circular end to make it slightly flatter, matching the reference using the direct selection tool.

I made outlines for certain parts, such as below, using the "outline stroke" option and the "minus front" pathfinder tool. The below shapes were created using the "unite" pathfinder tool to join the rectangle and circle.

The more complex shapes, such as the grip and the trigger, were created using the pen tool, exercising the skills I had learnt in using BÃ©zier curves earlier in the week.

Initially the pistol looked somewhat inconsistent against the other icons due to the outlines being quite a bit thinner, but I wanted to have a fairly consistent stroke weight between the icons to maintain cohesion via the principle of unity. I applied a larger stroke, which I used in conjunction with the "minus front" pathfinder tool to enlarge the outlines.

### Map
For the map, I used the rectangle tool to create two squares and the outline stroke tool, and "minus front" pathfinder tool to create an outline on the inner square. I used the polygon tool set to 3 sides to create triangles, and used them to create 'tears' in the edge of the paper with the "minus front" pathfinder tool, for a more weathered look to fit with the steampunk aesthetic. I used the line tool, circle tool, "outline stroke" and the "minus front" pathfinder tool to create the dotted line and the pin. I initially created another option where there was an X rather than a pin, but I felt the X implied that this was a pirate related game whereas the pin helped convey the 'mid-century' imagery needed for the "steampunk" theme.

### Stats, Menu and "Dream Machine" + Revision
I created the Moon shape for the "Activate Dream Machine" button using two circles and the "Minus front" pathfinder tool. I created the power button also using the "minus front" option, using a circle with no fill and a stroke, and a line down the middle, and used "minus front" with a circle to create a "hole" with space for the icon in the moon. The Stats button was created similarly to the basic shape of the map, using "outline stroke" and the pathfinder to create an outline inside the shape, except I created the shape by flattening the sides of a circle with the direct selection tool. The menu button was very straightforward, consisting of 3 lines with heavy strokes, which each had rounded caps. I used the distribution tools to make them equal distance from one another.

Having now created prototypes for all the icons, I evaluated all of them considering my original platform, context and audience. I think these icons were suitable for a stylised RPG game with steampunk aesthetic influences, on the PC platform. This was evident in my use of simple icons (which stuck to the 'flat design' brief), while touching into the 'steampunk' theme on some of the icons, such as the cog design for settings, the 'retro' pistol design for weapons, the old tv for stats, the weathered map, and the suitcase for inventory. The choice of blues and purples for (most) of the backgrounds of the icons, along with the highly stylised "swirl", helped communicate the 'dream' theme as well as the stylised, cartoonish nature of the game. The icons borrowed from many 'universal' symbols associated with the ideas they were to represent, making the game accessible to a wide audience, but particularly the target audience who I imagine would be quite well versed in the kinds of icons used in these games. My use of contrast with the white icons against more saturated background colours helped further reinforce the icons' accessibility. In addition, via this use of colour, I employed the princible of emphasis to make the white icons themselves the focal point of the images rather than the background. While only a couple of the icons employed symmetry (interact, boss-fight, menu and to an extent map and stats), the rest seemed to my eyes to have successfully employed the principal of balance otherwise, with the white icons distributed in a way that seemed equal in power to the backgrounds. The use of asymmetrical balance in most of the icons gives them a pleasing harmony which is inviting for the user, while still allowing the buttons to create movement and thus imply action.

I did, however make some changes. I reinforced the purpose of the icons using the element of "colour" to distinguish them, while sticking to a single analogous colour scheme for all icons but the "boss fight" icon, using the principle of "unity" to make the icons more cohesive. Furthermore, this created some variety, which was very important as the use of the principle of pattern in the background shapes could otherwise make the icons disinteresting. The system buttons (settings, menu, stats) use a lighter blue, while most ingame buttons (interact, inventory, map, pistol) use purple to reinforce the "dream" theme. I wanted the "activate dream machine" button (a unique and integral mechanic to the game) to stand out from the other in-game icons, so I coloured it dark blue (this also reinforced the 'night-time' moon imagery in the icon). Otherwise, as before, the boss-fight button uses a different analogous colour scheme based on the colour red to make it stand out from all the other buttons (as a 'special event' in the game), and to indicate danger to the user. The only other change I made at this point was to tilt the pistol slightly diagonally, as most other icons featured diagonal lines, thus this would create cohesion via the principle of unity.

## HTML

As I was away with COVID, I followed the Introduction to HTML slides from home, learning the basic functions based on the instructions on the slides. This activity helped me get a handle on basic HTML syntax and understanding the conventions of the language, which are important skills for a web designer, and will be very helpful for this assignment as we will need to edit a template HTML document which we will use to display our final interactive icons.

We were then instructed to download the templates for the assignment and experiment with changing, resizing and moving the icons. After trying different configurations, I was happiest with their original sizing, but I distributed them so the background colours of the icons were symettrical. I changed the background colour of the page to one I felt best suited the icon set.
