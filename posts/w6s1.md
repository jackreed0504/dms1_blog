## Image-Swap Icons
Continuing the **Prototype** stage of design thinking, I created prototypes for how the icons would react when a mouse hovers over.  I used the Design Principles of Emphasis and Contrast, employing the element of size with the main icon becoming larger, and the element of tone with the background colours becoming darker. This helped emphasise the idea associated with the icon and provide clear feedback for the user's feedback. I used the Illustrator "Recolour" tool to change the background colour of the icons, dragging the "adjust brightness" slider down by approximately a quarter for each icon to quickly darken the backgrounds. I then used the scale tool to increase the size of each icon by 20%.

## Sound

### Learning Sound and HTML (and JavaScript)
Absent while isolating with COVID, I followed along with the 'Sound and HTML' slides from home. I put all my icons into the page from last week, and as per the slides, used JavaScript functions to play sounds (which I sourced from YouTube) when a mouse hovers over, as well as creating an image swap with HTML. This is an important skill for anyone learning the field of interactive design, as JavaScript is the language which provides most of this interactivity to HTML. I found it interesting and engaging, and think that the troubleshooting process when it initially didn't work helped me in the process of learning how HTML and JavaScript work, however the slides were very 'copy-paste' and I wonder if I would have learnt a little more if I attended the class in person.

### Gathering and Creating sounds for final
The assignment page specifies that our final project requires "thematically appropriate" sounds for every icon as a form of feedback for interacting with them. I chose a mix of very tactile sounds which reflect the video-game platform (video-games tend to have very reactive UIs for user feedback), and 'dreamier' sounds to reflect the dream prompt/theme of the game. 

The Interact icon sound I created myself, stacking notes from a small toy metal xylophone to create a major chord (as it was 'positive' sounding), which I placed through a modulation reverb for a dreamy sound. I froze the audio and halved the speed (and pitch along with it) to increase the haziness/dreamy sound. 

The Boss-Fight icon sound, "Percussion Hit" by tyops (https://freesound.org/people/tyops/sounds/475040/?) was downloaded from freesound.org. I edited it to remove the drum roll at the start, and shorten the reverb/decay tail, so it was shorter and more tactile. I used this sound as it was quite dramatic, appropriate for the theme of this icon.

I sourced the Inventory icon sound from the YouTube audio Library (the sound was called "Keys in Lock"). I liked it as it was quite tactile and represented opening something. It was a fairly long recording with lots of usable sounds, so I picked a short section which was most effective in communicating the meaning of the icon.

The sound I used for the Settings Icon, "Running Gear" by Vurca (https://freesound.org/people/Vurca/sounds/315753/) was sourced from freesound.org. I edited it so it just featured the end of the sound, as it ran for quite long, but I felt it had the desired tacitlity and its mechanical sound contributed to the steampunk aesthetic of the game.

The sound for the Stats icon was "SciFi, Beeping Technology 02.wav" by MATRIXXX_ (https://freesound.org/people/MATRIXXX_/sounds/431901/) and was sourced from freesound.org. I used it due to the old steampunk-looking screen which is featured in the icon. I wanted to highlight the steampunk aesthetic through the sound, using a beeping technology sound effect to achieve this. The original sound was very fast, long and complex, as well as piercing and high pitched, which made it annoying rather than accessible when the user hovered over. I halved the time of the clip, making it lower pitched, and selected a small section at the start, to fix these problems.

The sound for the Menu icon was a recording of me hitting a key on a mechanical keyboard. I wanted the icon to have a tactile response sound, and I believe a mechanical keyboard is quite representative of a basic tactile button sound. Furthermore, I associate the escape key on a keyboard with exiting to the game menu, so I figured it would be an appropriate communication of this idea.

For the Map icon, I used the sound "Paper Crunching" from the Youtube Audio Library. I felt like communicating the sound of paper was important as the map featured on the icon was paper, and the sound of paper crunching is a distinct and tactile sound.

The Activate Dream Machine button was created by me. Similar to the Interact button, I started with a toy xylophone, this time making three succeeding tones to make a tritone along with a modulation reverb for dreaminess, though I needed it to be extra dreamy and 'trippy' as it was the dream machine. I started experimenting with the delay, while automating the delay time to make trippy 'whirring noises' (which I imagine the machine would make). I froze this audio and cropped out the original tri-tone so only the trippy delay noises were still there.

Lastly, for the Weapons icon I used the "Gun Reload" sound from YouTube's Audio Library, as I wanted a tactile sound that clearly declared the idea of 'weapons', as well as the image of the 'gun' on the icon, to the user. The original sound was long and included many different sounds related to a gun reloading, but I trimmed it down to the main gun reloading sound in the first couple of secons. 

### Creating the Final Website
Using the same things I learned in the Sound in HTML slides, I added sound and image swaps for when the user hovers their cursor over, to the template project from last week. I then uploaded this to Github and published the page via Github pages, creating an interactive prototype of all of the icons.
