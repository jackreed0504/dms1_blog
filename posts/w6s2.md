While I originally used CSS for the image swap, Thomas showed us an alternative way where JavaScript was used for both the image swap and the sound, which I felt worked better as it allowed me to program a specific amount of time for the image swap to last for. I also decided to make the button respond when clicked (onmousedown) rather than when the user hovers the mouse over (onmouseover), as autoplay policies have made it so a user has to click on the page before sounds can be played.
