# Solar System

In class, we created a replica solar system in the game engine Unity. This task helped us become acquainted with some of the basic functions of the program, such as creating and modifying 3D objects, materials, skyboxes and lighting. For reference, we used the website (Solar System Scope)[https://www.solarsystemscope.com/] which allows the user to interact with a 3D model of the solar system. In addition, the website provides the textures used in the model, which I used in mine. We were instructed to either capture scientific accuracy or a creative twist in our model. I went for the former option with mine. 

I created the basic shape of the planets by creating spheres, using "+">3D Object>Sphere. To change the size of each, which I based off of Solar System Scope, I used the Scale Tool. At first, I arranged them in vaguely the position I saw in the model using the Move Tool, as I hadn't yet considered how I would make the measurements more accurate.

At first I added textures to the planets by dragging the jpegs onto the spheres, though I later realised this wasn't the correct method.

I used the Move Tool to rearrange the planets along the Grid in Unity, matching them to the grid in Solar System Scope in an attempt to get a "scientifically accurate" scale. You have to zoom in quite close to this image to see the arrangment.

I made materials for the planets using the correct method. This was to create a material using Right Click>Create>Material and to drag the jpeg into the Albedo box. I applied these to the planets by dragging them onto the models. I created a skybox using Right Click>Create>Material, and selecting Skybox>Panoramic in the Shader drop down.

I created a ring for Saturn (the texture for which was provided by Solar System Scope) by creating a sphere and using the Scale tool to shrink it on its Y axis, flattening it.
