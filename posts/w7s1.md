# Solar System

In class, we created a replica solar system in the game engine Unity. This task helped us become acquainted with some of the basic functions of the program, such as creating and modifying 3D objects, materials, skyboxes and lighting. For reference, we used the website (Solar System Scope)[https://www.solarsystemscope.com/] which allows the user to interact with a 3D model of the solar system. In addition, the website provides the textures used in the model, which I used in mine. We were instructed to either capture scientific accuracy or a creative twist in our model. I went for the former option with mine. 

I created the basic shape of the planets by creating spheres, using "+">3D Object>Sphere. At first, I arranged them in vaguely the position I saw in the model, as I hadn't yet considered how I would make the measurements more accurate.
