# Solar System

In class, we created a replica solar system in the game engine Unity. This task helped us become acquainted with some of the basic functions of the program, such as creating and modifying 3D objects, materials, skyboxes and lighting. For reference, we used the website [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/) which allows the user to interact with a 3D model of the solar system. In addition, the website provides the textures used in the model, which I used in mine. We were instructed to either capture scientific accuracy or a creative twist in our model. I went for the former option with mine. 

I created the basic shape of the planets by creating spheres, using "+">3D Object>Sphere. To change the size of each, which I based off of Solar System Scope, I used the Scale Tool. At first, I arranged them in vaguely the position I saw in the model using the Move Tool, as I hadn't yet considered how I would make the measurements more accurate.

At first I added textures to the planets by dragging the jpegs onto the spheres, though I later realised this wasn't the correct method.

I used the Move Tool to rearrange the planets along the Grid in Unity, matching them to the grid in Solar System Scope in an attempt to get a "scientifically accurate" scale. You have to zoom in quite close to this image to see the arrangment.

I made materials for the planets using the correct method. This was to create a material using Right Click>Create>Material and to drag the jpeg into the Albedo box. I applied these to the planets by dragging them onto the models. I created a skybox using Right Click>Create>Material, and selecting Skybox>Panoramic in the Shader drop down. I added lighting coming from the sun by placing a Point Light inside the sun and increasing its range to extend along all the planets.

I created a ring for Saturn (the texture for which was provided by Solar System Scope) by creating a sphere and using the Scale tool to shrink it on its Y axis, flattening it.

# Assignment 3 Planning

To begin planning for my 3D Digital Environment, I created a Mindmap about Change/Transformation. This addresses the **Ideate** stage of design thinking, where I quickly generate ideas. The environment must be based on a meaningful change or transformation I have undergone, and gradually evolve throughout the user's journey. I thought about what significant changes I have undergone, which I identified as my changing of uni courses, becoming and adult, graduating high school and moving houses as a child. Branching from these were different concepts that I felt were connected to these events.

![mindmap](/w07s1/mindmap.png)

To produce inspiration to further help me develop these ideas, I thought about some video games which displayed changes similar to the ones I brainstormed. I was particularly interested in how change is exhibited in the Katamari games, collecting different items to make their katamari bigger, which can help the player gain access over different obstacles such as ramps. I was also interested in Ōkami, one of my favourite games, where you use your "celestial brush" to bloom cursed trees and areas back into life.

Going on to the **Prototype** stage, I generated a map which would demonstrate my environment. My concept is for the user to need to climb a mountain to finish the game, however they cannot do this until they have grown big enought to do so. In order to grow, they must water all the trees in the world. There will be a mirror at the beginning and end of the map so the user can see their character's growth from child to adult. As the user progresses, the colours will go from completely desaturated to having a full, vibrant colour display.

![map](/w07s1/map.png)

The change I have chosen to depict is entering adulthood. The key moments and how they articulate the personal change in my concept include:

1. The mirrors at the start and the end of the map: As the user begins there is a mirror where they can see the player model in a child-like form. By the time they can climb the mountain the player model will have grown larger and changed to an "adult" version, which they can see in the mirror at the end of the map. 

2. The trees in the map will grow/gain leaves when the user waters them with a provided watering can (clicks on the tree). The tree growing signifies growth, and the growing of the branches signifies the neural connections which are fostered as you grow, allowing you to achieve new things. This demonstrates the process of learning how to interact with the 'real world' as you enter adulthood.

3. By the end of the game you are able to climb the mountain at the end of the map, which represents the things that you are able to achieve by growing in different ways as symbolised in the trees the user has watered, and symbolises the culmination of the process of growing and learning to navigate adult life.

The assets which will likely be required for my environment include:

### Models:
* Child man
* Adult man
* Bare tree
* Tree with leaves
* Mirror
* Watering Can
### Textures
* Grass
* Gravel
* Reflective mirror
### Sounds
* Footsteps
* Water pouring

I am thinking of using low-poly assets to make the game easier to run and to upload to Unity Play. Aesthetically I would also be interested in using cel-shaded assets as I like that aesthetic in Ōkami. In both cases, I could perhaps demonstrate a change from a low-poly/cel-shaded aesthetic to a more realistic one, to represent dealing with the 'real-world', although this would probably be way above my skill level. The use of a cel-shaded aesthetic can also be used to evoke nostalgia for a 'simpler' past, and childhood cartoons, as nostalgia is an emotion that I often experience as I begin to enter adulthood.
