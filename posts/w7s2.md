# Player Controllers
In class, we were guided through the process of importing a first-person player controller package into Unity, which is an integral device in developing 3D environments. A player controller package provides an object (which can be simply dragged into the scene) which can be controlled by the user using game controls, and also acts as a camera. This was placed on a Terrain Object. (created using "+">3D Object>Terrain)

# Designing Terrain
We were walked through the process of designing a terrain using the "Paint Terrain" tools, which allow you to execute functions such as raising, lowering and smoothing areas of a terrain, and applying different textures, using a familiar brush tool. I experimented with the different tools to raise and lower terrain and create mountains.

We then created terrain layers for the path and the grass using Edit Terrain Layers>Create Layers. I did the gravel texture first, as it was the base layer of the terrain, and then added the grass, which I used the brush tool to paint over with.

# Greybox Prototype
Continuing the **Prototype** stage of design thinking, for homework we created a greybox prototype of our environment, which is a layout which uses primitive shapes. This helps us plan out and test the layout and navigation of the game, utilising the navigation concepts which we learned in class.

I began by creating a 300x300 terrain object and placing the player controller on it.

I used the terrain paint tool to raise the terrain, creating the mountain at the end of the map.

I used framing in the entrance to entice the user, created with rescaled cube objects, as they are looking directly into the mirror and the central tree, inviting the user through the entrance doorway.

I used resclaed cube objects to represent the mirrors and the gateways, and cylinder objects to represent the trees. I also used rescaled cubes to create the paths. There is a straight path directing towards the mountain, which orients itself as a landmark due to its scale. Furthermore, the user will be drawn into it by the "threshold" gate infront of it, which has both the functions of sigalling a change (the symbolism of growing up as the user moves through) and framing the importance of the mountain. All these aspects would draw the user into going directly towards the mountain. The oblique paths around the trees and eventually towards the mountain would then direct the user on a slower journey around the map where they take on the process of growth.
