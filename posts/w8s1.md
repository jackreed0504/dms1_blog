# Designing Space

When we design a digital environment, we are designing for an environment that can be navigated through and viewed from all different angles and locations by the user, as they can control the camera. To help us understand this concept, we were tasked with recreating the below image in Unity, so it would appear to represent this image through the camera but look completely different from another angle.

This image contains many of the design concepts we learnt in class such as perspective in the leadling lines from the pier and and depth via the repeating wooden stakes that get smaller into the distance. However, in my recreation of this, this is just an illusion and these items are not where they appear to be. I designed this using primitives and reshaping and moving them using the transform tools (move,scale) I kept the camera view open so that I could easily compose the image while making the actual placement of the objects as strange as possible.

# Assets

In class we learnt how to import assets into unity from sketchfab, which is a key skill in achieving our final task which will be made using premade assets. As it was much easier than using the website, I used the plugin which we were shown to import assets. As I want to use a tree model, and I want to go for a cartoony cel-shaded look in my game, I looked on sketchfab for a cartoony tree model, making sure it was low-poly to ensure the game would run well. I placed a player controller in my scene so I could walk around and look at the model in first person.

Finding a model that I liked and importing it, I then applied a collider to it so that the character would not walk through it. For some reason, the mesh collider would not apply correctly (it was larger than the object), so I used a capsule collider instead, which I was able to resize to fit the model.

(It works!!!)

Though this was not a set part of the task, I was keen on learning how to make my assets look cel shaded. I did some research and found out that Unity does offer their own "toon shader" (a shader, from my research is a program which renders the graphics of an object). I downloaded and imported this package into my project, which allowed me to apply it to the tree. It removes the realistic shading, and there is an option to add an outline, which I turned on and experimented with the widths and colours until I found one I was happy with. (Note from future self: it looks weird in this screenshot because I hadn't yet figured out that I was supposed to choose a darker shade, for a shadow to appear on the object)

# Homework

## Assets

I didn't read the homework tasks correctly, and ended up replacing my assets before iterating on my design using what we learned in terms of spatial design in class. Also, my greybox prototype was acting buggy when I replaced the objects with new assets, so I just worked on the project I started in class. 

I reshaped the terrain to not only include the final mountain, but to have a more natural/realistic bumpy and hilly terrain, using the raise/lower terrain tool. I created a new texture layer to make the terrain look like grass, instead of a really big chess board. I then placed copies of the tree over the terrain, as they were placed in the greybox prototype.

I found a model of a watering can, so that the player can pick it up and water the trees to make them grow. I applied the toon shader and an outline to it to fit in with the look of the trees. 

![hw2](/w08s1/hw2.png)

I didn't like the look of the original grass texture, as it didn't fit with the cartoony look of the rest of the assets. I downloaded a new stylised texture pack and used this to replace the grass, and design the dirt patches and the paths (following the same design as the greybox prototype). I also added the mirrors at the "start"  and "end" of the environment using an asset from sketchfab, and decorated the area with rocks and tree stump and log assets from sketchfab. I used the toon shader on all of these and applied outlines.

The ring of rocks around this tree is supposed to mark it as a landmark in the environment, as the last tree directly before the final mountain. It should also guide the viewer in this general direction, as a point of interest.

## Spatial Design

At this point, I had to reconsider my initial idea, which was involving interacting with the trees to grow them. This was quite ambitious for me, who has previous no experience in Unity. Furthermore, this idea does not help me with the general idea of the assignment, which involves using spatial and navigation design to convey the meaning. I scrapped this idea and instead focused on expressing growth through the change of things, such as trees, along the path (saplings at beginning of path, trees at end). I may make the character physically grow in scale as they walk. I also scrapped the mirrors idea, as I was conveying the concept in other ways and it would be too complex at my skill level to change the character's appearance.

I made the hilly parts in the outer parts more drastic with, using the concept of 'space and void' to direct the user down the main path which was emptier and more straightforward.

![hw3](/w08s1/hw3.png)

At the beginning of the environment, I placed a large metal fence entrance using sketchfab assets, and using the toon shader with an outline. This uses the technique of framing from last week, as the entrance displays landmarks such as the central tree and the mountain, inviting them to move in. I wanted the gates to have a large, looming feel, which is achieved through their scale and the industrial metal look. This should convey how small the user feels at the start of the journey (as this is a journey of becoming an adult.)

![gates](/w08s1/gates.png)

I added fences, from a sketchfab asset on the side of the main path, which use perspective lines and depth to draw the viewer towards the mountain. As the fences are arranged in a line, they appear to form perspective lines which point towards the mountain. Their repeating shape, appearing smaller into the distance, creates a sense of depth and guides the viewers eye towards the central tree and mountain. I made the fences appear as if they look more broken they get you get closer to the mountain, and they eventually stop, allowing the viewer to move freely. This conveys the feeling of boundaries breaking down, and the independence which you gain as you enter adulthood.
