# Sound In Unity

## Classwork

In class, we learned went through how to implement sound in Unity. We were given three loopable sound assets; a piano, a flute and a guitar, to practice this. To implement sound, you must first ensure there is an Audio Listener component attached to an object in the project. There was already one attached to the player controller which we were using for the project. Next, you need to attach an Audio Source component to the object from which the sound will be located. I chose the tree, set 'audio clip' to the guitar loop. There were several options within the Audio Source component which I selected in order to get the correct outcome:

* I checked 'loop', so that the audio would play in an endless loop.
* I set the 'spatial blend' to 3D, which means the audio acts as if it exists within the 3D world (ie. if I move closer to the tree, the sound is more audible/louder in volume, plus stereo panning reflects its position in the field).
* I set the 'doppler' level to 0 which eliminates an effect where the pitch changes in relation to your position, this effect is normally not favourable unless creating an effect such as a truck moving past quickly.
* I set the 'volume rolloff' to linear which means the volume rolls off into the distance steadily rather than in a curve. This is not physically accurate but it is more straightforward to understand and set up.
* I set the 'minimum distance' to 1 and the 'maximum distance' to 100. This means the sound is highest in volume when the character is 1 unit away, and lowest in volume/can't be heard past 100 units away.

## Homework

Next, I needed to select the type of audio I wanted in my environment. Firstly, as this was an outdoor environment, I figured it would be important to include sound which would materialise the surroundings (referred to as 'sense of place' in the slides). I found an ambient recording called Spring Day Forest in the YouTube Audio Library, which contained the outdoors ambience which I needed. I used Ableton Live to edit the sound down to an area which would loop seamlessly, and exported this as a WAV (I initilly tried an mp3 but this actually prevents the loop from playing seamelessly). I added an Audio Source component to my player controller camera, with 'audio clip' set to this loop, the 'loop' function checked and the spatial blend set to 2D as this would be heard at all times. I didn't edit any of the 'space' related settings such as min and max distance, as these would have no effect.

My theme of becoming an adult is one that carries a profound emotional weight to me, as growing and changing can bring a mix of happy and melancholic emotions. I wanted to reflect this through a moody, atmospheric ambient soundtrack. An inspiration that came to mind was c418's Minecraft soundtrack. In addition, after seeing a clip of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze in class, where the music develops depending on the area the player is in, I was inspired to make a soundtrack which dynamically reacts to the player's movement to reflect the concept of change. To achieve both of these ideas, I created 4 loops of droning chords with a cinematic sounding synth pad in Ableton Live, each higher in pitch than the other. I also used a highpass filter on the first two to make the effect that the music was 'opening up'. I covered the terrain with an array of 12 planes with invisible materials, which would each hold an Audio Source component.

Each Audio Source had the volume rolloff set to linear and the max distance set to 75, which allowed each chord to slightly overlap so that they would crossfade in a way that made the transition sound natural. I also made sure 'loop' was checked so they played continuously, and set doppler to 0 so the pitch was always the same. I originally set the 'spatial blend' to 2D so it would not have a panning effect, but this means all the chords play at once regardless of the player's position, so I set it back to 3D.
I would love to later experiment further on this with different instruments across the loops, such as a drum beat, an arpeggiated synth or piano chords.

In order to draw the player towards the trees, I created a pinging sound with a delay in Ableton, that loops. To make it fit in with the soundtrack and reflect the player's progression through the environment, I made loops with different notes depending on the area in the environment, so they would be higher in pitch the closer the player was to the mountain. These sounds were played through Audio Source components attached to the trees, which played at a maximum distance of 60 with a linear rolloff. A maximum distance of 60 meant that the player could hear trees which were in their periphery/out of their way without this sound being overpowering.

# C# Scripting

I wanted the player to be able to pick up the watering can to 'water' the trees and make them grow, and for that I needed to use C# scripting. I followed along with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPcYr3tL3Sc) which provided a script which worked flawlessly, the only things I changed was I made the player pickup the item using a mouse click rather than 'E', and I disabled the ability to drop the item as I didn't need this. I needed to create an empty object within the camera called 'holdPosition', and place it where I wanted the object to appear in the player's camera, and select this object in the script component. I also needed to set the collider on the watering can to be a trigger, which allows it to trigger game events via scripting, upon an interaction related to the collider (ie, pressing a key while looking at the collider). The watering can kept flying away when I did this but I found out this was because there were two colliders on the object, which were intersecting, so I deleted the non-trigger collider. I also needed to put the watering can on a new tag called 'canPickUp', to identify it to the script. 
To my understanding (for the purpose of trying to learn how C# scripting works), the script first produces a raycast which detects if you have hit the object. The script then checks if the object is a rigidbody (which allows physics to be applied to the object, allowing it to detect and trigger events through collisions and raycasts). Then, the script checks if the object uses the 'canPickUp' tag, and checks if it is in the set 'pickup range'. If all of these are true, transforms the object so it is in the area of the 'holdPosition' object. In addition, it places the object on a new layer (which I created) called the HoldLayer, putting it in a completely different environment than the other objects so that it doesn't clip through walls.
