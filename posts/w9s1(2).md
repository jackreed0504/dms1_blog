# Developing the environment + C# scripting

Based on the script I used to pick up the watering can, I wrote a script called ChangeSizeScript, which was attached to the player. This script was intended make the trees grow larger when they are 'watered' by the player. To make it simpler, I first made a script to make the trees grow when clicked, by firing a raycast from the player which would trigger a transform command on the tree. The script initially didn't work so I debugged it by adding a line to print a message to different parts of the script to see which line was at fault. I soon found that it was the GetKey.MouseButton(0) line, which is not the correct syntax. I changed it to GetMouseButtonDown(0) and the script worked.

After the success here, I made it so that the player would grow when they water the tree as well, but this would cause them to be stuck in the ground. I then found out that this was due to the planes from which the soundtrack was produced: these had unnecesarry colliders on them. Once I removed them, the successfully grew larger after watering the plant. 

![playersize](/w08s2/playersize.png)

However, my initial concept of the player's size enabling them to climb up a steep mountain at the end didn't work, no matter how shallow I made the mountain, the player's size didn't seem to have a large difference in their ability to make it up the mountain. I ended up making the mountain shallow enough to climb upon at any size using the 'raise and lower terrain' tool, scrapping this 'objective' from the environment. I also moved the trees from outside the gates in at this point, simply because I wanted the gates to be the entrance to the environment.

![shallowmountain](/w08s2/shallowmountain.png)

I wanted to improve upon this idea of the trees growing, showing the trees grow leaves rather than just increase in size. I opened the tree model in blender and the "stylised forest" model where I got the models for the rocks and the logs, and took the bushes from the trees on that model, placing them on the tree model to make a model for the grown tree. 

![growntree](/w08s2/growntree.png)

From my research, I found that I could use the 'Instantiate' function in my script to place my new model in place of the old one. I made sure to copy the dimensions for the scale of the last one, and applied these to the newly placed trees through a transform command. However, the new tree seemed to not place in the same position as the old one, instead appearing above where the player was standing when they pressed. 

![instantiate](/w08s2/instantiatee.png)

I found out this was happening because the transform.position and transform.rotation variables in the instantiate command referred  to the GameObject with the script attached. I tried making the script get the transform of the tree pressed and applying that to the new tree, but this didn't work. I then tried making a new script called "change prefab", which was attached to all of the trees. The function to place a new prefab in the same position would be called by the original script by using the GetComponent command on the clicked tree, getting the script component and calling the function (titled NewPrefab). This worked, although one problem was that the tree would appear on a 90 degree angle. I used a transform command to set the rotation coordinates to 0 on all axes to fix this. Another problem was that it only worked if I was directly against the tree when firing the raycast, which turned out to be because I had forgotten to put the 'canClick' tag, which the script would use to identify the trees, onto the trees. Also, I made the texture of the leaves darker here in the shader settings to fit with the darker green of the grass, as the leaves were quite a bright green. 

![treegrow](/w08s2/treegrow.png)

I made a tag called "GotCan" which would be attached to the player when they clicked the watering can via the PickUpScript (used to pick up the watering can). I added a tag check to the ChangeSizeScript to make sure the player had this tag before the tree grows, effective making sure they have a watering can in hand when watering the trees.

![gotcan](/w08s2/gotcan.png)

I wanted the tree to grow in size rather than just growing leaves, so I added a transform to make it increase size by 5 on all axes. I tried applying a mesh collider and applying "setActive(false)" to the original tree via script while this happens, but the mesh collider didn't work which I presume is because the tree is a prefab (it wouldn't apply to the children objects), so instead I decided to not "setActive(false)" the original tree. 

![size2](/w08s2/size2.png)

I got rid of the function for the player to grow in size. While it helped convey the idea of growing up and change, when the player got bigger it made it harder to press on the trees. Furthermore, as I scrapped the original idea of climbing up a steep mountain at the end, this wasn't necessary. Instead, the player would have height over the environment in the final mountain, juxtaposed with the gates towering over them at the beginning. I didn't like how the tree growing in size happened instantly, and wanted it instead to get bigger over a set time (ie. 1 second) so it was more of an 'animation'. From my research, I found that I could use a coroutine, so I copied some code for this and edited it for my purposes. 

![coroutine](/w08s2/coroutine.png)

I changed the painting of the terrain so that the winding dirt paths didnt start infront of the gates, as they did before. I made sure they went past every tree, looping around one on each side to contribute to the 'winding path', which makes the user spend longer exploring before they get to the end. This evokes the idea that growing up and becoming an adult is a period of discovery, exploration and newfound independence. To further evoke this, I moved the dirt paths to start right after the fences end, rather than the paths starting behind the fences as they did before, conveying the idea of independence after a period of being restricted by the fences. 

![terrain](/w08s2/terrain.png)

To make it easier for the player to know where they are pressing, I created a Canvas object. By right clicking and pressing UI>Image, I was able to place an image on the UI. On the inspector for the Image object, when you press 'Source Image', Unity provides some default assets that can be used here. I just selected a circle, scaled it down and placed it in the center of the screen.

![cursor](/w08s2/cursor.png)

I wanted there to be an event which would take place when the player climbed up the mountain, so I decided that the camera would turn greyscale when they climb, so as they look back at the view from the mountain it is as if they are looking into the past, conveying the emotional, melancholic and nostalgic feelings that come to me when I think about becoming an adult. To make the camera greyscale, I downloaded and installed the Universal Render Pipeline package, this render pipeline has colour correction enabled by default. I then needed to create a Global Object and press Add Override > Post-Pocessing > Colour adjustments and turn the saturation to zero. When both the Global Object and the main camera were on the "Default" layer, the effect is applied. 

With this knowledge, I put the Global Object on a seperate layer called "kamera". I placed a cube on the top of the mountain and wrote and attached a script called "blackwhite", which would detect a collision (OnTriggerEnter) and move the Global Object to the "Default" layer. When the player moves out of the cube (OnTriggerExit), the Global Object moves back to the "kamera" layer.

![greyscale](/w08s2/greyscale.png)

Rather than having the player walk into a cube, I wanted this area to look a little nicer and more consistent with the style of the rest of the level. I put an invisible shader on the cube and created an archway, which would both act as a threshold to reinforce the change in the colour/change in time with the greyscale camera, and as 'framing' to draw attention to the view from the mountain (the view into the past). For this, I used a model of a portal from sketchfab, applied the toon shader to make it consistent with the rest of the environment, and scaled it so only the top half could be seen and the player could walk through.

![arch](/w08s2/greyscale.png)

I needed it to be as clear as possible to the user that they needed to pick up the watering can and use it to water the trees. I decided to download an asset of a pedestal from sketchfab, apply the toon shader for visual consistency, and bury it into the ground so it was eye level with the viewer. I placed it directly infront of the tree to make the action they should take clear. To further highlight it, I placed a spotlight above it with an extremely strong 100 luminescence. 

![pedestal](/w08s2/pedestal.png)

When I switched to the Universal Render Pipeline, the watering can started clipping through other objects. It turned out that the way I had previously set the camera as an overlay did not work in the URP, and I needed to do it another way: setting the second camera's render type to 'overlay' and putting it in a 'stack' with the first camera. 

![clipping](/w08s2/clipping.png)

For some reason, the HoldPos (game object which defines where the watering can goes when picked up) wasn't working, and I couldn't find anything in the scripts or in Unity itself which addressed the problem. This meant the watering can would default to where the player clicked when picked up, blocking their vision and making it harder to tell they picked it up. I managed to fix it by applying a transform in the script, and moving it to the right by 0.5 units when picked up. I also moved it down slightly to get a position I was happy with.
