I uploaded the environment to Unity Play and sent it to a couple of friends, Sarah and Muneer to playtest it and fill out my survey. While it would have been ideal to do this in person, I had a bad cold at the time. Sarah is studying animation and has an interest in game design, while Muneer comes from an audio background, as a producer and singer. The results were interesting and gave me some very useful insight into how I could improve my environment.

# Screen Recording

Unfortunately Sarah couldn't get her screen recording working, although Muneer could:

Some of the main things I noticed here were:

* There seem to be technical issues with the trees, it looks like Muneer had to press a few times to get the tree to grow
* Although I tried to lead the player around at first using the spiral paths, it seems like the straight path makes it logical to go straight up the hill before watering the trees. Maybe I could have two paths coming from the spiral paths on either side, leading up the hill.

One thing I was pleased to see was that Muneer clearly was directed to pick up the watering can and water the trees. While Sarah didn't mention the trees in the survey, I messaged her afterwards to double check, she successfully picked up the watering can but did not water the trees due to technical difficulties. This would potentially prevent the viewer from seeing the evolution of the environment take place.

# Survey results and notes for improvement

I may have to look into changing the mouse sensitivity, though I think this may have been a problem with the Unity Play platform. I will also have to look into the issues with the soundtrack, which are an issue with using the 3D environment to display different parts of the soundtrack.

It seems like the use of dead trees seemed to imply to both participants that this game was about "reviving" trees, or had an apocalyptic theme which is not what I was aiming for. Maybe I could replace the trees with models of saplings. The fences at the start should be intimidating, rather than signify the area being special.

While the user should feel relaxed to an extent, I was hoping to see words like "nostalgia" or "melancholic". I might try and evoke this through the soundtrack, adding lo-fi sounds such as piano chords with pitch wobble. I think warm, sunbathing are fairly appropriate emotions for the concept. However, "curious", "dizzy", and the hills making it feel "weird" were not my intention. I may try evening out the terrain to fix this.

No notes here, this is good news!

I'm pretty satisfied with these responses as this was mostly my intention, however since there was no mention of the mountain I think I should make it stand out better, possibly by evening out the rest of the terrain as mentioned earlier.

I was successful in this regard as both playtesters agreed that the environment evolved throught their journey.
