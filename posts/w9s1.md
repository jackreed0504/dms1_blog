# Building

In class we went through the steps of how to build for Unity Play and for Mac, so that we can export a version to get feedback from our friends, and eventually build a final product to be assessed. We installed a Unity Package called WebGL publisher to do this. I did have some minor issues with this application at first; I needed to untick the "Auto Graphics API" option in the project settings, and after some further research I found that I also needed to change the Colour Space to Gamma. After making these changes, the build worked, and the game seemed to run smoothly in Unity Play.

# Recording

In the final submission we will be including a screen recording of ourselves navigating through the environment, which will be used incase the submitted game doesn't work. We were shown how to record the Unity screen via a Unity package which adds this feature to the project, however I tried using QuickTime player on my computer and found that this was easy to use and provided good results.

# Acquiring Feedback

In order to improve upon our game and ensure that it is a.) meeting the specifications of the assignment rubric well and b.) achieving our conceptual intentions, we are encouraged to get some friends to playtest our game and provide feedback through a Google Form. In groups of two to three, we were tasked to look through the slides from this unit and pick out some key terms related to particular design techniques, which we could use to phrase questions that determine we are using these techniques effectively. I did this for the Sound In Unity slides for my group:

We were then shown how to create a Google Form to survey our participants. I followed along, coming up with 6 potential questions I would ask, but I will probably revise this form later when I begin playtesting.
